0,"How to reach the Low-level settings Changing Low-level settings can cause problems with the performance of AdGuard, may break the Internet connection or compromise your security and privacy. You should only open this section if you are sure of what you are doing or our support-team has asked you about it. To go to Low-level settings, tap the gear icon at the bottom right of the screen to open Settings. Select the General section and then toggle on the Advanced mode switch, after that the Advanced settings section will appear below. Tap Advanced settings to reach the Low-level settings section. Low-level settings Tunnel mode There are two main tunnel modes: Split and Full. Split-Tunnel mode provides compatibility of AdGuard and so-called ""Personal VPN"" apps. In Full-Tunnel mode no other VPN can work simultaneously with AdGuard. There is a specific feature of Split-Tunnel mode: if DNS proxy does not perform well, for example, if the response from the AdGuard DNS server was not returned in time, iOS will ""amerce"" it and reroute traffic through DNS server, specified in iOS settings. No ads are blocked at this time and DNS traffic is not encrypted. In Full-Tunnel mode only the DNS server specified in AdGuard settings is used. If it does not respond, the Internet will simply not work. Enabled Full-Tunnel mode may cause the incorrect performance of some programs (for instance, Facetime), and lead to problems with app updates. By default, AdGuard uses Split-Tunnel mode as the most stable option. There is also an additional mode called Full-Tunnel (without VPN icon). This is exactly the same as Full-Tunnel mode, but it is set up so that the VPN icon is not displayed in the system line. Blocking mode In this module you can select the way AdGuard will respond to DNS queries that should be blocked: REFUSED — respond with REFUSED code NXDOMAIN — respond with NXDOMAIN code Unspecified IP — respond with zero IP address Custom IP — respond with a manually set IP address Block IPv6 By moving the toggle to the right, you activate IPv6 query blocking (AAAA requests). Blocked response TTL Here you can specify the TTL (time to live) value that will be returned in response to a blocked request. Bootstrap servers For DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS, and DNS-over-QUIC a bootstrap server is required for getting the IP address of the main DNS server. If not specified, the DNS server from iOS settings is used as the bootstrap server. Fallback servers Here you can specify an alternate server to which a request will be rerouted if the main server fails to respond. If not specified, the system DNS server will be used as the fallback. It is also possible to specify none, in this case, there will be no fallback server set and only the main DNS server will be used. Background app refresh time Here you can select the frequency at which the application will check for filter updates while in the background. Note that update checks will not be performed more often than the specified period, but the exact intervals may not be respected. "
1,"There are five major AdGuard projects on Crowdin — AdGuard Applications, AdGuard Websites, AdGuard Ad Blocker Knowledge base, AdGuard VPN Knowledge Base, and AdGuard DNS Knowledge Base. We do not have clear guidelines on which files or products of the AdGuard Applications project to start with. Just choose any product you like. There are just a couple of things we want to mention: You can see the app only in those languages for which all translations are completed in Crowdin; We recommend translating the descriptions for app stores in the second place, because without the translation of products themselves, the descriptions won't be needed. The situation is different in the AdGuard Websites project. Languages can be added to the site even if a full set of translations is not available. However, this depends on which files have already been translated. That's why we recommend that you start with the most important files — they are listed below: AdGuard Ad Blocker website critical.resx auth.resx welcome.resx AdGuard VPN website critical.resx auth.resx AdGuard DNS website critical.resx auth.resx Adding new strings as well as updating existing ones in these files requires special attention from the project translators and proofreaders. In addition to websites, there is a file for translating transactional emails in the AdGuard Websites project. Newly added strings in this file also have a high translation priority. "

3,"We have written this article to avoid confusion and explain in detail how you can renew/upgrade an outdated (legacy) AdGuard license. About the outdated licenses Initially licenses of the following types were available to activate AdGuard products: Standard — for desktop applications AdGuard for Windows/AdGuard for Mac Mobile — for mobile applications AdGuard for Android/AdGuard for iOS Premium — a license that combines desktop + mobile application Standard and Mobile licenses could be purchased for 1 to 9 devices. Standard were valid only for desktops, and Mobile were only for smartphones and tablets. Premium licenses could have been used on 2-18 devices. Depending on the number of devices selected upon purchasing, they allowed you to simultaneously activate AdGuard on an equal number of computers and mobile devices: 2+2, 3+3, etc. For example, you might have had a Premium license for 2+2 devices, that is, the license could be installed on 2 computers and 2 phones/tablets. Or, for example, for 9+9 (18 devices in total), then the license could be installed on 9 computers and 9 phones/tablets. For all types (Standard, Mobile, Premium) there were options for a Yearly and Lifetime license. In October 2019 AdGuard switched to the new licensing system: from then on, licenses can still be purchased for 1 year or Lifetime, but their types have become Personal (for up to 3 devices) or Family (for up to 9 devices). One more change: license keys of the new type can now be used on any device, in any combination. For example, a Personal License can be installed on Android, Mac and iOS, just like on two Windows computers and an Apple tablet, etc. What happened to the outdated licenses? Standard were automatically made universal, which means that they can be activated on any devices. Mobile licenses remained unchanged and platform-limited (they can still only be used on phones or tablets). Premium licenses also remained unchanged and platform-limited. And although Premium licenses are now displayed in your personal account by the total number of devices, they can still be activated on desktop + mobile set of devices. For example, this is how the 1+1 key looks like: But despite the total number of devices (2) it can be activated on 1 desktop and 1 mobile device. All the outdated licenses have a ""legacy"" badge in the AdGuard account. And they are automatically converted to a new type when you either renew or upgrade them. But there are some nuances. Let's see which licenses can be converted to a new type and how to do it. I have an outdated (legacy) key. What renewal/upgrade options are available for me? You can check this on the renewal page or in your AdGuard account: Go to ""My licenses"" tab and check what actions are available to you for each specific key. Below we will explain with specific examples. Licenses for 1/2/3 devices Yearly licenses for 1, 2, 3 devices can be converted to either Personal or Family: Choose based on how many devices you need to protect. Instead of renewal you can switch to Lifetime: Lifetime licenses can only be converted to Family (9 devices) due to technical limitations: Licenses for 4+ devices (up to 9) Yearly keys of this configuration can only be converted into a Family license: Lifetime licenses for 4 or more devices cannot be upgraded due to technical limitation: Licenses for 9+ devices Premium keys (5+5 and more) and custom keys for 10+ devices that you purchased individually with the help of our managers. These are quite unique cases, so if you want to upgrade your license to Lifetime, please contact us at partners@adguard.com. We will make you a special offer depending on the specific configuration of your license. "
4,"In a nutshell Apple's Mail app now uses a proxy to hide a user's IP address when downloading images from emails. However, it won't work if there's an active VPN connection. As it treats AdGuard as a VPN, it won't preload images automatically. Apple explains this issue here. In detail AdGuard for Mac now uses macOS built-in socket filtering based on the network extensions API. This new and rather buggy mechanism replaced good old Kernel extensions. Over the last 1.5 years, we've reported more than 20(!) bugs to Apple regarding their new filtering method. The network extensions API has a VPN-like configuration with a list of route-like entries. On Big Sur, AdGuard used ""split-tunnel"" rules to avoid creating the ""default route"" rule because it causes problems on early Big Sur releases. These problems were solved in Monterey so nothing prevents us from using the ""default route"" rule. On Monterey, iCloud Private Relay got introduced. Privacy features of Mail.app also use Private Relay servers. As a result, AdGuard can't work together with iCloud Private Relay and Mail.app privacy features: iCloud Private Relay is applied to connections at the library level - before they reach the socket level, where AdGuard operates. iCloud Private Relay uses QUIC, which AdGuard can't filter because HTTP/3 filtering is not yet available. As AdGuard blocks QUIC, including iCloud Private Relay traffic - otherwise, ad blocking is impossible. When you use iCloud Private Relay and switch AdGuard into the ""split-tunnel"" mode, you can't open websites in Safari. To work around this issue for Monterey, we apply the ""default route"" rule. When Private Relay sees that rule, it disables itself automatically. So, AdGuard works seamlessly on Monterey, but iCloud Private Relay gets disabled. network.extension.monterey.force.split.tunnel restores the ""Big Sur"" behavior, but this option may break access to websites due to (3) and (4). We keep searching for a solution to this issue. One of the options is implementing HTTP/3 filtering. Recommended solution At this point, we recommend using a more traditional VPN service, such as AdGuard VPN, instead of the new Apple's privacy features. "
5,"This page describes the features and details of AdGuard’s central management of policies and preferences. 1. Download the MSI {#msi-download} Download the AdGuard MSI. 2. Configure the settings for your network {#settings-configuring} On machines that are joined to an Active Directory domain, policy settings may also be stored in the registry under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE in the following path: Software\Policies\AdGuard\. The only supported policy is LicenseKey. If this policy is set, AdGuard will prefer it over what user can enter in the interface. This license key will be used for checking license status. 3. Make sure that AdGuard servers are available {#servers-available} AdGuard connects to two hosts: api.adguard.org and filters.adtidy.org. Make sure that both servers are available. 4. Push the MSI out to your network {#msi-push} If you usually use SMS or other tools, use them to push out the AdGuard MSI just as you would normally do with any other installation bundle. Otherwise, you can run the MSI on the target machine directly (and silently) with this command: Msiexec /q /i AdGuard.msi If you need to roll out an update, use this command: Msiexec /q /i AdGuard.msi REINSTALL=ALL REINSTALLMODE=vomus Please note, that you must run these commands with admin privileges. If you want to install AdGuard on a Windows 7 computer, make sure that it has .NET 4 Client Profile installed: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24872 Important! Automatic updates are disabled when you install AdGuard for Windows from MSI. If you want to allow updates for a user (which is not recommended because centralized updates will become impossible), set the value of the AllowCheckUpdates parameter for the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Adguard key to YES (case insensitive). In this case automatic updates will be allowed, any other value or no value for this parameter disables automatic updates. 5. Test your installation {#installation-test} On a target machine, launch AdGuard. Open the license screen to check that it uses the one you've set. You might need to click ""Refresh status"" to make AdGuard validate the license key. "
6,"AdGuard for Mac, as one of our main staples, merits a full how-to guide. We decided to help new users out and to highlight some finer, but less obvious points that even seasoned AdGuard for Mac fans might have been missing. AdGuard for Mac is a standalone ad blocker for macOS. While AdGuard for Safari is limited in ad-blocking capabilities due to Safari Content Blocking, AdGuard for Mac is full-fledged and can offer more to its users. Let us walk you through the main features. Home panel The first thing you see upon startup will be a screen with a big On/Off toggle. Below are shown various stats (ads blocked, trackers blocked, data saved) since the installation or since the last stats reset. To start configuring AdGuard for Mac, you need to click the gear in the upper right corner of the window and select ""Preferences"". General Preferences Descriptions under option titles seem self-explanatory, but still: Activate language-specific filters automatically Enabling this option, you won't have to manually choose all the filters when visiting a foreign website, saving you some time. Launch AdGuard at login A simple and convenient feature with which you don't have to worry whether or not you have your ad blocker turned on, and just be sure that ads are always blocked. Do not block search ads and websites' self-promotion This option might be useful to online shoppers: instead of adding all your favorite e-shops and sites to the Allowlist, you can simply exclude self-promos and search ads from filtering. AdGuard will automatically detect those and let them be, while removing everything else ad-like. Hide menu bar icon If you don't want to see the menu bar icon, there is an option to hide it. But don't worry: even if you remove it from the menu bar, AdGuard will continue to run in the background. From this same window you can access the above-mentioned Allowlist, to which you can add websites you do not wish AdGuard to filter. Just click the corresponding button located at the bottom of the window. Filters Filters are the main driving force behind the Ad blocker module. To understand how filtering works, get acquainted with our comprehensive article. But in essence, filter lists are sets of rules written in a special language, and your ad blocker is an interpreter of these rules who then implements them. As a result, you stop seeing ads on your web pages and life gets lots better. Some filter lists (AdGuard’s Base filter, Annoyances filter, EasyList, etc.) are pre-installed, while other specific ones, adapted to your preferences, can be downloaded additionally and added to your program. Aside from the more general and universally applicable filters (like Base filter), AdGuard provides an extensive quantity of filters for every occasion: filters aimed at tracking prevention (like Tracking Protection filter), language-specific ad filters that block content in a selected language, Social media filter that removes ""Like"" and ""Share"" buttons, Annoyances filter for cookie warnings, in-page pop-ups and others of the same ilk, and even a filter that unblocks some ads instead of blocking them — Filter for search ads and self-promotions. AdGuard filters are automatically updated. Our developers create them all based on user feedback received. You can always help other AdGuard users (and yourself, in perspective) by sending us reports right from the app's Assistant (it's really handy, we'll tell you more about the Assistant further on), or from the website. If you wish to know more about AdGuard filters, here is some info. User rules Another vital part of the Ad Blocker module are its User rules. If you have some coding experience and would like to create your own rules that would be a better custom fit than the standard filters already available, then you can try your hand at this. The syntax AdGuard uses for its filtering rules is based on that of any other ad blocking extension, but with considerable additions, extending its possibilities. The whole process of rule-writing in all its nuances is described in these comprehensive instructions, so if you want to write some custom rules and check how much of a coder you are, just follow the steps we described in this article. DNS DNS filtering is one of the most useful features, thanks to which all your DNS traffic is encrypted. But if you're using the default DNS server provided by your ISP, your DNS traffic is likely not encrypted and vulnerable to snooping and hijacking. In the DNS panel you can select the DNS servers from known DNS providers or even add custom DNS servers. Also you can add domains to DNS blocklist or allowlist and add complicated rules using DNS rules syntax. Finally, you can add DNS filters of your choice. Stealth Mode This module is a very useful tool that will help you maintain your privacy from websites that try to retain such info about you as your IP address, computer parameters, browser settings and even the initial page from which you were redirected, not to mention cart contents if we speak of web stores. If this list of info potentially to be shared with shady third parties doesn't make you think twice, then might we add that in most cases they will also get such personal data as your age, yearly income, medical history, physical address and your kids' names. Eliminating such things as unwanted cookies or clandestine insertion of tracking parameters into your browser is what Stealth Mode does best. Stealth Mode contains a wide range of options, which ensure its flexible configuration. They are divided into several categories, and for an unprepared user many of them will seem confusing and maybe even complicated. We provided each option with a hint to make up for the deficiency — hints appear when you hover over the icon with a question mark. If you still wish to know more about the whole concept, we encourage you to proceed to this article. Browsing Security Next we have the Security panel, where a module also known as Browsing Security is located. What it does is protection from malicious and phishing websites. Note that AdGuard is not an antivirus, but an entirely different program. It will show you a warning if you are about to go onto an infected domain, but it cannot stop you from downloading anything suspicious or help you deal with already existing viruses. Phishing is a very common web fraud aimed at stealing personal data (passwords, bank account details, etc.). It is carried out using fake web pages mimicking popular websites or real services, such as web stores or social networks. Many phishing websites have URLs that only differ from the real ones in just a few symbols to put you off your guard. If a user enters their details on such a website, they’ll definitely end up in the wrong hands. Browsing Security gives strong protection against such incidents. At the same time, the user’s personal information is not transferred anywhere, and AdGuard servers do not know which websites the user is visiting, because the security check is not performed via open web address (URL) but through hash prefixes (hash is a certain data structure that renders each address added to the base unambiguous). Some web pages are not malicious themselves, but they may contain elements built into their structure by other websites. Unlike browser plug-ins, Browsing Security module checks each object built into any web page, ensuring maximum protection. If you wish to help us in perfecting this module, you can check the lower box on the panel near the ""Help us with Browsing Security filters development"" phrase. This will enable your computer to send us pertinent info on fraudulent websites you might stumble upon while surfing the web — and our developers will make sure they end up locked at the bottom of your ban list. Browser Assistant AdGuard Browser Assistant’s primary function is to manage filtering directly from the browser. It used to be a mere userscript incorporated into AdGuard for Mac app that then became a full-fledged browser extension. Know more about the benefits it yields. You will be prompted to install the Browser Assistant for your default browser when you first install AdGuard (during the onboarding process). If you missed it, you can download it for any browser at any time. Extensions Extensions are small programs that do exactly what their name implies — they extend functionality. And AdGuard uses several extensions of its own, also called userscripts, to broaden its functions range: 1. AdGuard Assistant (legacy version) This extension assists the user in changing basic AdGuard settings within the browser, without the need to open the app itself. Like Browser Assistant, legacy Assistant works with all macOS compatible browsers. Thanks to this little tool you can do several things without having to leave the browser: add a certain webpage to the ""do not block"" list, choose and block an especially annoying element on the page, report the website if it still manages to get ads through to you. Note that this version of Assistant is legacy and there is no point in using it on new systems, since it has been replaced with the full-fledged Browser Assistant. But legacy Assistant might be of help if there is no Browser Assistant extension for your browser. 2. AdGuard Extra This extension is used to solve the more complicated ad blocking cases you might encounter. We would recommend you to always keep it switched on, unless you have a serious reason not to. 3. AdGuard Popup Blocker Prevents all these annoying popup windows from opening when you view webpages. Blocks popup ads on web pages. One of the important features of AdGuard for Mac is that the application can work as a cross-browser userscript manager. You can easily add any scripts you like and manage existing ones without having to switch browsers every time. Network This last panel is dedicated to Network filtering, and you will find extra functionalities here. We do recommend to enable the first two ones: ""Automatically filter applications"" and ""Filter HTTPS protocol"". Those are an important added precaution to better filter your web space. HTTP is the primary protocol for transmitting information over the Internet. Most data including ads is transferred via it, but it has one disadvantage — the connection is unencrypted. Thanks to the HTTPS filtering feature AdGuard has, not only HTTP traffic is filtered, but also HTTPS traffic (S stands for ‘secure’). There are also the options of ""Do not filter websites with EV certificates"" and ""Use AdGuard as an HTTP Proxy"". Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificates offer a stronger safety guarantee; owners of such websites have to pass a thorough and globally standardized identity verification process defined by EV guidelines. Which is the reason why some users trust websites with such certificates and prefer not to filter them. As for the second option — well, yes, in fact you can use AdGuard as a regular HTTP proxy server. All traffic coming through it will be filtered. This proxy will also be available on your local network, so you may use it for traffic filtering on other devices that are able to reach the proxy directly. To filter traffic on another device connected to proxy you will need to install an AdGuard root certificate there. After you configure proxy, open your browser and go to this page. Others There are other useful AdGuard options that shouldn't go unnoticed in this article, since they add much to user experience. License First, there's the License tab that you can open from the dropdown main menu (the one that opens once you click the gear icon on the upper right of the main window). From this tab you can see which license type you are using, check its status and validity period. In this same tab you can refresh your license status, renew your license or reset the license key using the corresponding buttons. Support Click the gear icon in the upper right corner, select ""Support"", and you will be able to send a bug report or a feature request to our support team. Be sure to add your real actual email though, because without it the message won't be sent. To report a missed ad or a broken website, please follow the link above the message window, we use a separate reporting tool for those types of issues. It is possible to attach a diagnostic report to your message, you only need to check the box in the lower part of the tab. Updates check Last but not least. You can check for filter and program updates by clicking the corresponding menu options in the dropdown menu (click the gear icon and you'll see it). "
7,"Previously known as low-level settings, Advanced Settings mostly contain settings that go beyond the average user's competence and don't have application in the everyday use. AdGuard for Windows is designed to work without ever having to change any of them, but they will provide additional options in some corner-case situations or when solving an uncommon problem. Mindlessly changing Advanced Settings can potentially cause problems with the performance of AdGuard, may break the Internet connection or compromise your security and privacy. You should only make changes to these settings if you are sure of what you are doing or if our support team has asked you to do so. How to reach Advanced Settings To go to Advanced settings, in the main windows click Settings → General Settings and scroll down to Advanced Settings. Alternatively, select Advanced → Advanced settings... in the tray menu. Advanced Settings Once you open Advanced Settings, you will be presented with the following options: Block TCP Fast Open If enabled, AdGuard will block TCP Fast Open in the Edge browser. To apply settings, you need to restart the browser. Exclude app from filtering by entering the full path If you want AdGuard not to filter any specific application, specify the full path to them and the apps will be excluded from filtering. Separate different paths by semicolons. Enable AdGuard pop-up notifications Enable this feature to see AdGuard pop-up notifications. They do not appear too often and contain only important information. You can also use the tray menu to recall the last pop-up notification. Automatically intercept filter subscription URLs Enable this feature if you want AdGuard to automatically intercept filter subscription URLs (i.e. abp:subscribe and alike) and to open a custom filter installation dialog. Use redirect driver mode If this option is enabled, AdGuard intercepts all the traffic and redirects it to the local proxy server for further filtering. Otherwise, AdGuard will filter all the traffic on the fly, without redirection. In this case, the system will consider AdGuard to be the sole application that connects to the Internet (other applications are routed through it). The downside is that it will make the system Firewall less effective. The upside is that this approach works a little bit faster. Open main window at system start-up Enable this option to make the main AdGuard window open after the system is loaded. Note that it doesn't affect whether the actual filtering service is launched or not, this setting is located in Settings → General Settings Filter localhost If you want AdGuard to filter loopback connections, check the box. This option will always be on if you have AdGuard VPN installed, because otherwise it won't be able to work. Enable HAR writing This option should be enabled only for debugging purposes. If you tick the checkmark, AdGuard will create a file that contains information about all filtered HTTP requests in HAR 1.2 format. This file can be analyzed with the Fiddler app. Note that it may slow down your web browsing significantly. Show QUIC Allows displaying the QUIC protocol records in the filtering log. For blocked requests only. Block Java Some websites and web services still support Java Plug-Ins. The API that serves as the basis for Java plug-ins has serious security vulnerabilities. You can disable such plug-ins for security purposes. Nevertheless, even if you decide to use Block Java option, JavaScript will still be enabled. Action applied to blocked DNS requests Here you can select the way AdGuard will respond to DNS queries that should be blocked: Reply with ""Refused"" error Reply with ""NxDomain"" error Reply with a custom IP address Custom IPv4 address If ""Custom IP address"" is selected as an action applied to blocked DNS requests, here you should specify the IPv4 address that will be returned in response to blocked ""A"" requests. If none are specified, AdGuard will reply with the default ""Refused"" error. Custom IPv6 address If ""Custom IP address"" is selected as an action applied to blocked DNS requests, here you should specify the IPv6 address that will be returned in response to blocked ""AAAA"" requests. If none are specified, AdGuard will reply with the default ""Refused"" error. Fallback servers Here you can specify an alternate DNS server to which a DNS request will be rerouted if the main server fails to respond within the timeout period specified in the next section. There are three options to choose from: Don’t use fallback servers; Use system default servers; Use custom servers. DNS server timeout period Here you can specify the time in milliseconds that AdGuard will wait for the response from the selected DNS server before resorting to fallback. If you don’t fill in this field or enter an invalid value, the value of 5000 will be used. List of custom fallback servers If you want AdGuard to use custom fallback servers, list them in this section, one per line. List of custom bootstrap addresses A bootstrap is an intermediate DNS server used to get the IP address of the secure DNS server you chose earlier in DNS protection. Such a ""middle ground"" is needed when using protocols that denote the server address by letters (such as DNS-over-TLS, for example). In this case, the bootstrap acts as a translator, transforming the letters into numbers your system can understand. By default, the system DNS resolver is used, and the initial bootstrap request is made through port 53. If this does not suit you, list here the IP addresses of the DNS servers that will be used to determine the address of the encrypted DNS server in the top-to-bottom order. The specified IP addresses will be applied in the order listed. If you specify invalid addresses, or no addresses at all, the system IPs will be used. DNS exclusions All DNS requests to domains listed here will be redirected to the system default DNS server instead of the DNS server specified in the app’s settings. Also, DNS blocking rules will not be applied to such requests. Block ECH If enabled, AdGuard strips Encrypted Client Hello parameters from responses. Enable filtering of secure DNS requests When enabled, AdGuard redirects secure DNS requests to the local DNS proxy, in addition to plain DNS requests. "
8,"What is AdGuard license A license is permission to use the AdGuard product, provided in accordance with the End User License Agreement. AdGuard licenses exist in the form of license keys, activation codes, and product cards in the user's AdGuard account. Some licenses need to be purchased (e.g. AdGuard Ad Blocker Personal), some are free and limited by term (e.g. trial licenses of AdGuard apps) or have a limited functionality (e.g. AdGuard for iOS or AdGuard Browser extension). Here's the list of all types of AdGuard Ad Blocker licenses. Trial licenses are free time-limited licenses with full functionality: AdGuard for Windows — 14-day trial, AdGuard for Mac — 14-day trial, AdGuard for Android — 7-day trial. Free licenses are not time-limited, but have limited functionality: AdGuard Browser extension, AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS. Subscriptions are paid licenses that are renewed automatically every month or every year. They can also be extended manually. AdGuard Ad Blocker Monthly subscription, AdGuard Ad Blocker 1-year subscription. Licenses purchased from distributors and gifted licenses are time-limited and cannot be renewed automatically. Though, they can be extended manually: AdGuard Ad Blocker Monthly license, AdGuard Ad Blocker 1-year license. Lifetime licenses are not time-limited and have full functionality: AdGuard Ad Blocker Lifetime, AdGuard Pro for iOS. How many devices can be added{#devices} Different licenses can be used with a different number of devices: Personal: up to three devices, Family: up to nine devices, AdGuard Pro for iOS: one device. To use your license on a device, log in to your AdGuard account on it. To extend the device limit, you can upgrade your license. What is a license key{#license-key} A license key is a unique sequence of characters that represents an AdGuard Ad Blocker license. It is automatically registered for the email you used for license purchase. With a license key, you can: log in to your AdGuard account in some products (e.g. AdGuard for Windows), activate your license in a product, if you don't have an AdGuard account, bind your license to your AdGuard account and unbind it. When unbinding a license, be sure you write the license key down beforehand or note in some other (safe) way. You'll need the key for re-binding your license or transferring it to another account. How to recover a license key You can easily check which license keys belong to you in your AdGuard Account. The license key is bound to your account via the email address you used to purchase AdGuard. Please note that it is often not enough to just find out what your license key is. If it was already used on another computer, it’s necessary to unbind it from that computer through the AdGuard Account before using it again. "
9,"The owners of phones, tablets, or TVs running the Android 7+ operating system might face the problem caused by using a profile with Restricted Mode. If you have such a profile, AdGuard, like other applications that use VPN, gets restrictions on selective filtering of VPN traffic. As a result, AdGuard cannot launch protection in a local VPN mode. Also, one of the reasons for this situation may be using Dual App/Dual Messenger profile on your device. Below are described the recommendations that you can apply when this problem occurs. Solutions You have three ways to solve the issue: Option 1: Grant permissions to AdGuard using ADB Please note, that this approach is available starting from AdGuard v3.5 nightly 6. If you're using an older version, you can get the latest update here. Activate the developer mode and enable USB debugging: Open the Settings app phone; Go to System section (last item in the settings menu). In this section, find the sub-item About phone; Tap the Build number line 7 times.

11,"This problem occurs almost exclusively on devices registered in South Korea. Samsung Pay occasionally doesn't work on such devices with running VPN services. However, there is a way to solve this problem. By default, AdGuard uses Local VPN to filter traffic. This was the reason why the South Korean users had to disable AdGuard when making payments with Samsung Pay. Now it is possible to avoid such difficulties. The ""pref.samsungpay.autopause.enable"" feature was developed specifically for South Korean users. So, what process does it initiate? If the ""pref.samsungpay.autopause.enable"" option is enabled, the AdGuard app is suspended when a user opens the Samsung Pay app. But once the app is closed, AdGuard resumes operation. Let's see how it works. Note: this feature will work only if the Local VPN filtering mode is chosen in AdGuard settings. If another mode is being used, Samsung Pay will function without any interruptions. "

15,"Sometimes you may notice that, according to Android built-in statistics, AdGuard consumes a lot of traffic and/or battery resource. Both these problems are two sides of the same coin. Since in the process of filtering all the mobile traffic goes through AdGuard, Android decides that it is AdGuard that consumes it all. In reality, of course, it is not true. Battery and traffic consumption shown in devices statistics do not represent the facts. The thing is, Android attributes all of the WiFi and Mobile traffic to AdGuard, which was in fact consumed by other apps. Due to this, AdGuards real share of total consumed traffic and battery resource increases, and the share of other apps, on the contrary, decreases. Own battery usage stats screen To mitigate this misconception, we added a new screen called 'Battery usage'. You can access it by tapping on the battery icon in the top right corner of the main screen. Inside you will find a chart that shows the AdGuard battery resource consumption within the last 24 hours, with an option to get more detailed hour-to-hour data by tapping on the dots on the chart. Besides that, there’s also a numeric breakdown of the relevant data and a short technical explanation. Real example On the screenshots below you can see the battery resource consumption statistics for a night and subsequent morning: From these screenshots you can see that: AdGuard, as expected, is at the top of the chart. This is generally typical for smartphones (and not at all for tablets without 4G, since WiFi is much less 'costly' in terms of battery consumption). Pay attention to the number of sent Mobile and WiFi packages, which were attributed to AdGuard (Mobile packets sent и Wi-Fi packets sent) on the second screenshot. On the third screenshot are stats for one of the real traffic consumers, Yandex.Browser. It was not attributed almost any traffic at all, while in reality 70% of the total traffic was consumed by it. How much battery resource does AdGuard really consume? First, let us lay down a little bit of theory and links with necessary data. Android derives traffic consumption judging on so-called Power Profile, which is given by every manufacturer: https://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/values.html Main part of Power Profile is a set of values in mAh which define battery consumption for every component of the device: https://source.android.com/devices/tech/power/values.html For example, from the table above: wifi.active= 31mA additional consumption in mAh caused by WiFi data exchange. radio.active= 100-300mA additional consumption in mAh caused by data exchange over Mobile network. cpu.active= 100-200mA additional consumption in mAh caused by CPU work. AdGuard by itself almost doesn't consume any traffic, so for the sake of evaluating battery resource consumption let's get rid of 'Mobile/WiFi packets' and stcik to 'CPU'. Formulа to calculate the consumption: ""CPU TIME (ms)"" X ""cpu.active"" / (60 * 60 * 1000) = ""POWER USE mAh"" Let's put real numbers into this formula. Let's take CPU total from the second screenshot and convert into milliseconds: 506000 A coefficient cpu.active for 2GHz will be roughly equal to 225mAh Final result 506000 * 225 / (60 * 60 * 1000) = 31,625mAh Conclusion Real consumption is several times less than it is shown in Android statistics. Instead of 220mAh it should be somewhere around 31-40mAh. On the other hand, browser's consumption should be not 66mAh, but ~200mAh. "
16,"Screenshot is a capture of your computer’s or mobile device’s screen, which can be obtained by using standard tools or a special program/app. Sometimes a screenshot (or screenshots) are requested by the support team for a better understanding. Here you will find all the necessary hotkeys you should know in order to take screenshots on your computer or mobile device. Android {#android} Taking a screenshot on an Android device can be done in various ways — depending on the device model and its manufacturer. Generally, you should use the following button combination for Android: Hold down at once the Volume Down and the Power buttons for 1–2 seconds Your Android device will capture the entire screen and save it as a photo. So, you can find the screenshot in a Screenshots folder in your Gallery. But, as it has been already said, there can be differences depending on a particular device. Let’s look at other possible combinations: Hold down at once Home and Power for 1–2 seconds; Hold down at once the Back and the Home buttons On Android 8 and later you can also take a screenshot with other manipulations, for example by placing your hand vertically along the left or right edge of your phone and swiping in from that edge with your hand touching the screen (Samsung devices), or you can do it with three fingers swiping down (OnePlus devices), etc. Find out about other options to take a screenshot in the settings of your device. Besides, you can always use any special applications for taking screenshots on your devices, for example — Screenshot Easy, Screenshot Ultimate, Screenshot Snap, etc. iOS {#ios} Any iOS device (barring ancient ones) lets you take a screenshot using standard tools. To take a screenshot on an iOS device, use the following combination: Press the Sleep/Wake (side) button and the Home button at the same time, then quickly release them and this one for iPhone X or later: Press the Sleep/Wake button and the Volume up button at the same time, then quickly release them Your iOS device will capture the entire screen and save it as a photo. You can find it in a standard Photo app. Windows {#windows} To take a screenshot on Windows, press the PrtScn button On some notebooks you have to hold Fn and then press PrtScn. Please note: PrtScn (Print Screen) button can be differently abbreviated on various keyboards — PrntScrn, PrtScn, PrtScr or PrtSc. Windows captures the entire screen and copies it to the (invisible) clipboard. To take a screenshot of an active window, use the following combination: Hold down Alt and press PrtScn (or Fn + Alt + PrtScn on some laptops) To take a screenshot of a specific area, you should use the following combination: Hold down Win (the Windows button) and Shift and press S After you take a screenshot, it will be saved in the clipboard. In most cases you will be able to paste it into a document that you are currently editing by using Ctrl + V button combination. Alternatively, if you need to save the screenshot into a file, you should open the standard Paint program (or any other app that can work with images). Paste your screenshot there using the same button combination or by clicking the Paste button (usually in the top left corner of the screen) and then save it. Windows 8 and 10 let you take a screenshot very quickly with a Win + PrtScn combination. As soon as you press these buttons, the screenshot will be automatically saved as a file to your Pictures → Screenshots Folder. There is also a dedicated program for taking screenshots called Snipping Tool that you can find via Start menu among standard programs of your computer. Snipping Tool lets you capture of any area of your desktop or the entire screen. After taking a screenshot using this program you can edit the picture and save it to any folder on your computer. Besides, you can also try using different apps for taking screenshots on your computer, like PicPick, Nimbus Screenshot, Screenshot Captor, Snipaste, Monosnap, etc. macOS {#mac} To take a screenshot on Mac, use the following button combination: Press and hold together ⌘ Cmd + Shift + 3 Your Mac will capture the entire screen and save it as a file on the desktop. To take a screenshot of an active window, use the following combination: Press and hold together ⌘ Cmd + Shift + 4 + Space bar. The pointer will change to a camera icon. Click the window to capture it. Press the Esc button to cancel taking a screenshot To take a screenshot of a specific area, you should use the following combination: Press and hold together ⌘ Cmd + Shift + 4. Drag the crosshair to select the needed area. Release your mouse or trackpad to take a screenshot, press the Esc button to cancel it. To take a screenshot of the Touch Bar (MacBook Pro) use the following combination: Hold down ⌘ Cmd + Shift + 6 Your Mac captures the entire Touch Bar and saves it as a file on the desktop. To copy a screenshot to the clipboard instead of saving it, hold down Ctrl together with any of the combinations above. Then you can paste the screenshot (from the clipboard) into a document or an image you are currently editing by using Cmd + V combination. You can also take screenshots by using Preview and choosing Take screenshot (of the selected area, window, or the entire screen). With Preview you can save your screenshots in JPG, TIFF, PDF, and other file formats. "

18,"By default, Tor Browser is added to AdGuard’s list of filtered applications. However, to filter it, AdGuard needs to change Tor's security settings. This will make Tor trust AdGuard's CA certificate. If you decide to filter Tor and check it in Preferences → Network → Applications, AdGuard will show you this dialog box: By updating Tor settings, AdGuard will set the following: security.enterprise_roots.enabled: true This setting will cause Tor to trust root certificates. Learn more security.cert_pinning.enforcement_level: 1 Public Key Pinning is a security measure that allows websites to ensure that the connection between a website and a user is authentic.

19,"AdGuard Assistant’s primary function is to manage filtering directly from the browser. It has existed for quite a long time, and its form and content have changed. More precisely, it used to be a mere userscript incorporated into the AdGuard for Mac app and became a full-fledged browser extension. Now it definitely yields more benefits. Benefits Independence AdGuard Browser Assistant is an extension installed in a browser, so there is no need to wait for the userscript to be injected into the filtered web page, as it was with the preceding one. In other words, it is more autonomous from the main AdGuard app. Still, Browser Assistant needs the installed AdGuard for Mac, because there is no point in using the extension without the app. Compatibility with the main app If you got into the habit of using our previous AdGuard ad blocker extension in Integration mode, you may like the solution that we have developed for the new Browser Assistant. Background information: In previous versions of the AdGuard Browser Extension (before v3.5), if you had it installed along with a desktop AdGuard for Mac, the extension took over the functions of Assistant, stopped filtering itself and relied on the app to do this. The extension and the app worked in conjunction but sometimes the integration would fail. Some websites would stop being protected by the desktop program and be backed up only by the less powerful extension. When using the Browser Assistant, all these problems don’t matter as there can be no conflicts in essence. The role of the Browser Assistant is well defined and it can’t hinder the functioning of the main app, so there is no need to worry. Smart onboarding When AdGuard for Mac is installed for the first time, the thing a user encounters in the first place is the onboarding. During this process the user quickly learns about AdGuard's settings and can customize filtering to their liking. At one stage AdGuard will determine the user's default browser and provide them with a download link for the new Assistant. On rare occasions, a browser may prove incompatible with the Browser Assistant, and the user will be offered to install the legacy version instead. Separate tab in settings The new Browser Assistant has its own tab in AdGuard for Mac settings, together with Stealth Mode, Browsing Security, Parental Control and others. Don’t worry if you missed the opportunity to install Browser Assistant during the onboarding, you'll find this option in the app's settings. Besides, there is a checkbox to enable the legacy Assistant. Legacy Assistant Legacy Assistant is the previous version of Assistant, which is a mere userscript, not a browser extension. Basically, there are two cases when you might want to pick it instead of the new Browser Assistant: 1) the new Assistant is not available for your browser; 2) you are used to the green shield icon and want to leave things as they were. If you recognize yourself in any of these scenarios, then the legacy version will suit you. How to install AdGuard Browser Assistant Technically, you won’t need to do it on your own: during the onboarding process AdGuard app will determine your default browser and offer to install Browser Assistant for it. Yet, if you missed that step, you can download it yourself. AdGuard Browser Assistant is available for all popular browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera, and Yandex. To install the Browser Assistant for your default browser, you can do it directly from the app settings, but you also have an opportunity to install it for other browsers. To install the one you need (or many, it is not prohibited but even encouraged), go to our website, click the browser icon and then the Install button. That’s it! "
20,"This article contains some of the most common errors that you can encounter during the AdGuard for Windows installation, and possible ways to solve them. Error 5: Access Denied {#error-5} This error occurs when there's something wrong with permissions. There may be several different reasons why AdGuard installer doesn't have the permissions it requires to properly finish the installation process. You can try the following steps: Temporarily disable your antiviruses. Some of them may interfere with the installation, depending on the severity of their settings. Choose a different installation folder. It is possible that the current installation folder has some access restrictions. Also make sure you don't select an external drive, a virtual drive, etc. Reboot your computer. Sometimes the permission issues are temporary and can be solved by restarting the PC. Error 112: Disk is full, Error 1632: Temporary folder full or inaccessible {#error-112} These are two different errors with very similar solutions. As their names suggest, AdGuard installer didn't find enough disk space to complete the installation. There are several things you can attempt to fix the problem: Uninstall some programs or delete unnecessary files from the drive you were trying to install AdGuard to. Download, install, and run AdwCleaner, a free piece of software by Malwarebytes. It will, among other things, clean your system from all kinds of extra ""leftover"" files that remain after incorrectly uninstall programs and such. It will help clean up some disk space. Reboot your computer. Sometimes temporary files can take up a considerable amount of disk space, and restarting your PC is the most reliable way to get rid of them. Error 1601: Windows Installer is not accessible {#error-1601} You could say this is a particular sub-case of Error 1603. The possible solutions are similar: Start and re-register Microsoft Installer service. It requires some work. Press Win + R and enter services.msc. Find in the list and double click Windows Installer. Hit Start button under Service status and hit OK. If the service status is running, you should click Stop first and then hit Start. Press Win + R, type and enter msiexec /unregister and hit Enter. Press Win + R again, type and enter msiexec /regserver and hit Enter Reboot the PC and start the installation all over again. Sometimes that's enough to fix the problem. Error 1602: Canceled by user {#error-1602} If you got this error code, chances are you have interrupted the installation process manually in one way or another. What you can do is: Don't close the installer window. When the installation is complete, it will close automatically. If a dialogue window pops up during the installation, hit ""Yes"" to grant the installer the required permissions. Clicking ""No"" will cancel the installation. Don't start other processes while the installation process is going on. Error 1603: Fatal error during installation {#error-1603} The error sounds scarier than it actually is. In reality, this is a rather generic error that can have many different causes, and some of them are easily fixed. Try the following solutions: Press the Win key, search for Command Prompt and run it. There, type in sfc /scannow and press Enter. Choose a different installation folder. It is possible that the current installation folder has some access restrictions. Also make sure you don't select an external drive, a virtual drive, etc. Uninstall AdGuard using our special uninstall tool and then repeat the installation. Start and re-register Microsoft Installer service. It requires some work. Press Win + R and enter services.msc. Find in the list and double click Windows Installer. Hit Start button under Service status and hit OK. If the service status is running, you should click Stop first and then hit Start. Press Win + R, type and enter msiexec /unregister and hit Enter. Press Win + R again, type and enter msiexec /regserver and hit Enter Acquire full permissions on the drive for installation. It is possible that the error 1603 occurs because you don’t have full permissions on the file location. It's also not as easy as some of the other solutions: Open File Explorer, right-click the drive containing the installation location and select Properties. Go to Security tab and click Edit. Single-click SYSTEM and ensure that the Allow box of every item in Permissions for SYSTEM is checked (if it is checkable). Do the same check for Administrators. Click OK to go back to Properties dialog. Then click Advanced. Click Change Permissions. On Permissions tab, double-click Administrators. Select This folder, subfolders and files for Applies to field and tick all the available Basic permissions. After that hit OK. Do the same operation above (from item 7) for SYSTEM. Click OK all the way out. Try installing AdGuard again. Error 1618: Another installation is already in progress {#error-1618} This error occurs when there are several instances of AdGuard installer launched at the same time. What to do if you get this error: Reboot your PC and start the installer again. When you restart the computer, all ongoing processes will stop, including all copies of the installer. Don't make multiple clicks on the installer even if doesn't start right away. Sometimes it may take a few seconds to display the installer UI. Error 1638: Another version of this product is already installed {#error-1638} It's very likely that you've already installed AdGuard before. Check if AdGuard is already installed on your computer. You can do it by pressing the Win key and typing in AdGuard. Maybe there's some leftover files from a previous AdGuard installation. Uninstall AdGuard using our special uninstall tool and then repeat the installation. Other errors {#other} If you've encountered an error that's not listed above, it is possible that we can solve it by ourselves. But in order to do that, we need log files from you. Please perform the following steps: Find and archive AdGuard installation logs as it is described in this article. Find and save to disk Event Viewer logs. This article explains how to do that. Please email all these files from two previous steps to the support team at support@adguard.com and describe the problem in the message body. Our tech support agents will reply to you as soon as possible. "
21,"VPN apps Other VPN apps are incompatible with AdGuard running in the Local VPN filtering mode since you cannot have two active VPNs at the same time. To solve this problem we suggest you: use AdGuard VPN — it has Integrated mode that allows two apps to operate seamlessly use AdGuard in Local HTTP Proxy mode. Please note that 'manual' HTTP Proxy mode is not supported on devices since Android 10 if you use a third-party VPN app, figure out whether it supports SOCKS4/SOCKS5 mode. If it does, you can configure your VPN app to work as outbound proxy and set up local outbound proxy with params from the third-party app. For instance, AdGuard can be automatically configured with 'Orbot: Proxy with Tor' Private DNS The Private DNS feature was introduced in Android Pie. Before version Q, Private DNS didn't break AdGuard DNS filtering logic and the DNS forwarding through AdGuard worked normally. But starting from version Q, the presence of Private DNS forces apps to redirect traffic through the system resolver instead of AdGuard. See Android devs blog for more details. Some device manufacturers keep Private DNS settings hidden and set 'Automatic' mode as a default one. Thus, disabling Private DNS is impossible but we can make the system think that the upstream is not valid by blocking it with a $network rule. For instance, if the system uses Google DNS by default, we can add rules |8.8.4.4^$network and |8.8.8.8^$network to block Google DNS. Unsupported browsers UC Browsers: UC Browser, UC Browser for x86, UC Mini, UC Browser HD To be able to filter HTTPS traffic, AdGuard requires the user to add a certificate to the device's trusted user certificates. Unfortunately, UC-family browsers don't trust user certificates, so AdGuard cannot perform HTTPS filtering there. Solution Requires root access. To solve this problem, move the certificate to the system certificate store. Opera mini: Opera mini, Opera mini with Yandex Opera mini drives traffic through a compression proxy by default and AdGuard is not able to decompress and filter it at the same time. Solution There is no solution at this moment. Dolphin Browser: Dolphin Browser, Dolphin Browser Express AdGuard cannot filter its traffic when operating in Manual proxy mode because this browser ignores system proxy settings. Solution Use Local VPN filtering mode. Puffin Browser: Puffin Browser, Puffin Browser Pro Puffin Browser drives traffic through a compression proxy by default and AdGuard is not able to decompress and filter it at the same time. Solution There is no solution at this moment. "
22,"AdGuard for Windows is an easy-to-use tool that blocks annoying banners, pop-ups, video ads and trackers. But that's not all: it helps you save traffic, load web pages faster, and guard your computer from undesirable and potentially malicious content. AdGuard can also protect you from phishing sites, and your children — from information they shouldn't be exposed to due to age restrictions. Home screen Once you start AdGuard for Windows, you will see the main screen of the app. Its most noticeable detail is the enable/disable protection button. Also, on this screen you can monitor blocked ads, trackers and threats statistics, find out the current version of the app or update it. Furthermore, there are four tabs in the upper right corner: Settings, Support, License, and About. Each of these is worth talking about separately. Settings Settings is the section that requires the most attention. This is where you can configure the app so that it fully meets your requirements: blocks only what bothers you, uses the DNS server of the trusted provider, removes third-party cookies, and so on. General settings Here you can set the language and theme (Dark or Light), enable AdGuard launching at system start-up and silent automatic updates, choose the update channel and filter update check interval. Also Settings is the place to go if AdGuard for Windows is not working properly and the support team asked you to collect Debug logs. At the very bottom of the screen you will find Advanced Settings. Changing some of them mindlessly may potentially cause problems with AdGuard's performance, break the Internet connection or compromise your security and privacy. That's why we suggest you open this section only if you are sure of what you are doing or our support team has asked you about it. If you want to understend what can be set up in Advanced Setting read the dedicated article. Ad Blocker This is the main module of AdGuard for Windows that removes ads from the websites you visit and from the apps installed on your device. To filter out advertising and privacy-threatening content such as banners, pop-ups, or trackers AdGuard uses different filters: groups of rules with a similar purpose written with a special syntax. To understand what filters are and how they work read this article. In the Ad Blocker module you can: enable automatic activation of language-specific filters, disable search ads and self-promotion blocking, activate pre-installed filters such as AdGuard Base filter, install filters from the list or add a custom filter by clicking the Add a filter button, make changes to existing rule groups using the Filter editor button, see all the requests sent by browsers and apps installed on your computer by clicking the Filtering log button. From there you can also block or unblock any request by creating a custom rule, compose a filter from your own rules written manually, imported or created with the AdGuard Assistant extension. Before you start manually writing your own rules read our detailed syntax guide. Stealth Mode Many websites gather information about their visitors, such as their IP addresses, information about the browser and operating system installed, screen resolution, and even what page the user came or was redirected from.

No, AdGuard for Windows is not an antivirus. It will neither stop the download of a virus when it's already started, nor delete the already existing ones. But it will warn you if you're about to proceed to a website whose domain has been added to our ""untrusted sites"" database, or to download a file from such website. You can find more information about how this module works in the dedicated article. In this module you can enable notifications to block requests to malicious and phishing sites, activate sound notifications, agree to submit anonymous security-related info to the AdGuard server to help us keep the malicious and fishing websites database up to date. In case you want to learn more about Browsing Security, read this article. DNS Protection There are three significant reasons why you might want to explore the DNS protection settings. First, to avoid being tracked by your ISP. Every time you open a website, for example google.com, your browser sends a request to a DNS server to get the IP address of the website in return. Usually, the DNS server belongs to your ISP, which allows them to track your online activity. Second, to encrypt you DNS traffic. And the third one is to block content on DNS level. In the DNS protection module of AdGuard for Windows you can select the DNS servers from known DNS providers, including AdGuard DNS that blocks ads and trackers, AdGuard DNS Family Protection that in addition blocks adult content, or AdGuard DNS Non-filtering that provides a secure and reliable connection, but doesn't filter anything. You can even add custom DNS servers. Also there is an option to add custom rules using DNS rules syntax. And if necessary, you can add DNS filters of your choice. Parental Control There are numerous websites access to which should be restricted if the PC is used by children. This task is accomplished by Parental Control. The module checks the contents of web pages opened in the browser and filters those with content undesirable for children: images and texts for adults, crude language, violence, drug propaganda, etc. Parental Control settings are password-protected so that the child is not able to go round the restrictions. This module not only blocks directions to undesirable sites but can also delete the links that are inappropriate for children from the search results. In the Parental Control module you can enable the Safe search and manage the blocklist and the allowlist to customize how this option works. You can also check the Block executable files download box to prevent your child from downloading and installing software on the computer. There are two more options in the Parental Control module: you can select a specific Windows user to be protected by Parental Control and set a password to protect AdGuard settings from change. Browser Assistant From this tab you can easily proceed to install AdGuard Browser Assistant, which primary function is to manage filtering directly from the browser. We explained more about how to work with it and what to do if there is no Browser Assistant for your browser in the separate article. Extensions AdGuard can significantly broaden website functionality working as a user script manager. AdGuard Users can add their own scripts, as well as manage existing ones. Automatically detect userscripts With this option enabled, AdGuard will automatically define browser queries to userscripts and suggest their installation. Otherwise, extensions can be downloaded and installed manually. The following extensions are installed with AdGuard: AdGuard Assistant AdGuard Assistant is Legacy Assistant that you may use if the new Assistant is not available for your browser. The name of this extension is quite deliberate: it actually assists the user in changing basic AdGuard settings right in the browser, without the need to open the app itself. AdGuard Assistant works with all Microsoft Windows compatible browsers. In addition, the AdGuard Assistant icon will not be displayed on websites listed as exceptions by the user and on certain web pages where there is a risk of incorrect content display. AdGuard Extra This is a custom extension designed to fight the technique of re-inserting blocked ads — the so-called ad blocker circumvention/ad reinjection. Both are advanced anti-ad blocker methods that continue to rise in popularity among advertisers. AdGuard Extra is essentially a mini-program that changes the way pages work,and it does so in such a way that it becomes much more difficult for sites to use the above-mentioned functions to bypass blockers. AdGuard Popup Blocker This extension prevents popup windows from opening when you view web pages. Some pop-ups are considered useful – they may contain settings for site administering or additional reference information demonstrated upon clicking a link. That is why you can turn off the Blocker if needed. This extension doesn’t work on websites added to the AdGuard exceptions list either. It is turned off by default, but you can turn it on in the application settings. You will find more detailed information about this extension in our Knowledge base. Web of Trust Web of Trust lets you see the reputation of each website based on its users’ opinions. The site is rated by a number of specific criteria: trust, security, etc. This extension is turned off by default, but you can turn it on in the application settings. Please, note that AdGuard is not the developer of this extension. Network The penultimate module is dedicated to network filtering, and here you will find additional network-related options. Two of them are enabled by default: Enable traffic filtering and Filter HTTPS protocol. These are important extra precautions to better filter your web space. Most websites are now using HTTPS, and the same applies to advertising. From many sites, like youtube.com, facebook.com and twitter.com, it is impossible to remove ads without HTTPS filtering. So keep the Filter HTTPS protocol feature enabled unless you have a strong reason not to. In this module you can check the checkbox ""Use AdGuard as an HTTP proxy"" to use AdGuard as a regular HTTP proxy which will filter all traffic passing through it. You can also enable the Filter websites with EV certificates feature. Extended Validation (EV) SSL Certificates offer a stronger safety guarantee; owners of such websites have to pass a thorough and globally standardized identity verification process defined by EV guidelines. Which is the reason why some users trust websites with such certificates and prefer not to filter them. At last, there is a section with proxy settings. There you can specify which proxy server AdGuard should use to update filters, get new versions and so on. AdGuard VPN The last section is dedicated to AdGuard VPN — an ideal tool that provides security and anonymity each time you browse the Internet. You can download it by clicking the Download button or go to the AdGuard VPN website by clicking the Homepage button. How does AdGuard VPN work? Without going into technical details, we can say that VPN creates a secure encrypted tunnel between the user's computer or mobile device and a remote VPN server. In this way, data confidentiality is preserved, as well as the anonymity of the user, because a third-party observer sees the IP address of the VPN server and not the actual user's IP. What AdGuard VPN does: hides your real whereabouts and helps you stay anonymous сhanges your IP address to protect your data from tracking encrypts your traffic to make it unreachable to scammers lets you configure where to use VPN and where not to (exclusions feature) To get more information about AdGuard VPN dive into the AdGuard VPN Knowledge Base. Others There are other useful AdGuard options that shouldn't go unnoticed in this article, since they add much to user experience. Support By clicking the Support tab you will open a dialog box through which you can report a bug, submit a feature request, or simply share your opinion of the product. License This tab contains information about your license. Here you can: find out the license type (nightly build, beta or release), the number of devices available for simultaneous connection to AdGuard, the license expiration date; click the button to go to the license purchase page, and activate, reset or recover a license. About In addition to information about the current version of the program, this tab provides some useful links to Licese Agreement, Privacy Policy, Acknowledgements, Discussions, and Version history pages. Check for updates To check for filters and userscripts updates, click the rotating arrows icon in the upper right corner of the app's main screen. Tray menu To save you time navigating around AdGuard menus, many of the frequently used options and settings are available from the tray menu. To call the menu, right-click the AdGuard icon in the tray. It will offer you the following options: enable protection disable protection: completely or for 30 seconds go to Settings open the Tools and Advanced menus check for filter updates check for app updates to recall the last pop-up message reach the Support and About sections close AdGuard, but continue filtering exit AdGuard "
23,"To be able to filter HTTPS traffic (which is extremely important as most ads use HTTPS), AdGuard needs to install a certificate into your device's user storage. On older versions of Android OS this was done automatically, but on Android 11 and later users have to install it manually. If you experience issues during the manual certificate installation (for example, you installed the certificate, but the application keeps ignoring it), you can find possible solutions below. Certificate installation in a Secure folder If you use the Secure folder on your Android (this applies mainly to Samsung devices), you may face some difficulties when installing the HTTPS certificate. The thing is that the Secure folder has its own storage where the certificates are stored. However, in case you do everything according to the instructions described here, the certificate is installed into the main storage and plays no role for your ad blocker in the Secure folder. So, in order to resolve this issue and install the certificate for your AdGuard for Android into the Secure folder's storage, follow this instruction: After installing the application and connecting to VPN tap Turn on next to the HTTPS filtering is off message. Tap Next → Next → Save it now → Allow. Save the certificate (at this stage, you can rename it to make it easier to find). After the How to install a certificate? screen appears, DO NOT tap Open Settings. Minimize the application and go to the secure folder. Tap the three-dot menu and go to additional security settings. Tap Install from memory → CA certificate → Install anyway → Enter a graphic key/password/fingerprint → Find the saved certificate and select it. Return to the AdGuard application and close the screen ""How to install a certificate?"" by tapping the cross button. Done! The certificate has been installed. "
24,"Sometimes in order to understand a problem and fix it we need to collect log files, or logs. Basically, these files contain information about the program and it's work. Collecting debug log To collect debug log and send it to us you need to perform following steps: Open AdGuard and go to ""Settings"". Choose ""Advanced"". Set ""Logging level"" to ""Record everything"". It's desirable to close all background apps that don't concern the problem beforehand. Reproduce the problem and set the logging level back to ""Default"". Notice the exact time when it happened. Send us a message from program by choosing ""Support"" → ""Send Feedback"" in the menu. Don't forget to check the ""Send detailed system info"" checkbox under the text field and to include the timestamp from the step 4 into the message. As an alternative, you can export the logs (along with the state.txt file that contains system information and information about AdGuard settings) directly into a local file. It can be convenient, for example, if you are having a conversation with a developer on GitHub, forum or on another platform. To export logs and system information into a file, go to ""Settings"" — ""Advanced"" and tap ""Export logs and system info"". Select the destination folder and tap ""Save"". Collecting web requests log To collect web requests log and send it to us you need to perform following steps: Open AdGuard and go to ""Settings"". Choose ""Advanced"". Set ""Logging level"" to ""Record web requests"". It's desirable to close all background apps that don't concern the problem beforehand.

25,"About system-wide filtering System-wide filtering means blocking ads and trackers beyond the Safari browser, i.e. in other apps and browsers. This article will tell you how to set it up on your iOS device. On iOS, the only way to block ads and trackers system-wide is to use DNS filtering. First, you have to enable DNS protection. To do so, open AdGuard for iOS settings → DNS protection and switch it on. Now, if your purpose is to block ads and trackers system-wide, you have two options: Enable AdGuard DNS server (Settings → DNS protection → DNS server → AdGuard DNS). Add a DNS filter/hosts file that will block ad and tracking domains, e.g. AdGuard DNS filter. The second option takes a bit more time to set up but has several advantages: You can use any DNS server at your discretion and you are not tied up to a specific blocking server. You can add multiple DNS filters and/or hosts files at the same time, but you can't use multiple DNS servers at once. How to add a DNS filter/hosts file You can add any DNS filter or hosts file, the instruction will be the same for all of them. For the sake of the example, let's add AdGuard DNS filter. It is composed of several other filters (AdGuard Base filter, Social Media filter, Tracking Protection filter, Mobile Ads filter, EasyList, EasyPrivacy, etc.) and it's simplified specifically to be better compatible with DNS-level ad blocking. Open AdGuard for iOS settings → General. Enable Advanced mode. The Advanced settings tab will appear. Open it. Note: We don't recommend touching other settings you'll find inside the Advanced settings tab, especially when it comes to Low-level settings. Some of them might break the Internet connection or compromise your privacy and security, so it's better to be careful. The text below describes the exact actions required to add AdGuard DNS filter. Copy this link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersRegistry/master/filters/filter_15_DnsFilter/filter.txt (it's a link for AdGuard DNS filter) Open AdGuard for iOS settings → DNS protection → DNS filtering (available while Advanced mode is enabled) → DNS filters. Click Add a filter, paste the link into the filter URL field, and click 'Next'. Add any number of other DNS filters the same way by pasting a different URL at step 3. You can find various filters and links to them here. "
26,"To analyse and diagnose different problems that may potentially arise, the AdGuard support service might need AdGuard log files. These files contain records about errors and other events that occurr with the software. Below is the brief instruction describing the way to get the log files and send them to the support service if necessary. Open the AdGuard settings. Go to the General Settings section, scroll down to the end of the screen and switch the Logging Level to Debug. Reproduce the issue. We strongly advise to take note of the exact time when you reproduced the issue: it will help our support team to find relevant log entries and solve the problem faster. Export the recorded logs using the Export Logs button. Save the archive to any folder. Important: after exporting the logs, set the logging level back to Standard. Debug logging level will slow down the application. Send the archive to the AdGuard support service at support@adguard.com, describe the problem and don't forget to mention the time when you reproduced the issue. Trace logs {#trace-logs} Sometimes support team members may ask you to send trace logs. Then you will need to do the following: Stop AdGuard by right-clicking the AdGuard icon in the tray menu and choosing Exit AdGuard: Please don't leave the service running: Open the console (type cmd in the start panel). Run the app with the command C:\""Program Files (x86)""\Adguard\Adguard.exe /trace if you are using 64-bit Windows, and C:\""Program Files""\Adguard\Adguard.exe /trace in case if you use 32-bit one. Select Debug logging level. Reproduce the issue. We strongly advise to take note of the exact time when you reproduced the issue: it will help our support team to find relevant log entries and solve the problem faster. Export the recorded logs using the Export Logs button. Important: after exporting the logs, set the logging level back to Standard. Debug logging level will slow down the application. Don't worry if the log file is large. We need to know as much detail as possible to fix your problem. "
27,"There are two options to activate premium features on AdGuard for iOS app: Purchase a subscription. Just tap the Get Premium plaque anywhere in the app and follow the on-screen instructions. All you'll need to do is enter your Apple ID password and confirm the purchase. You can choose between a monthly, yearly and lifetime subscriptions. Use an AdGuard license (you can purchase it at the AdGuard website). Log into your AdGuard personal account via the app: go to AdGuard app → Settings → License screen and tap the Login button there. You'll be asked to enter your AdGuard Personal account credentials*. After you do, if you have any valid license key in your account, it will be automatically picked up to activate Premium in your AdGuard for iOS app. As an alternative, you can just enter a valid license key in the e-mail field leaving password field blank to activate Premium features. PS: AdGuard Pro for iOS (our other iOS app) can only be purchased from App Store. "
28,"Two-factor authentication (or 2FA) is an authentication method that requires an additional piece of evidence from the user to log in, on top of the usual login and password pair. This is done for security purposes. Websites usually offer such 2FA methods as a code sent by SMS or a special authenticator app. We see adding a 2FA option as a benefit. We also understand that enforcing it may irritate some users. That's why we made it optional for your personal account on adguard.com — by default, 2FA is disabled when you register a new account. You can enable it manually in the settings. As for the currently available authentication methods, we use the tried and tested one: an authenticator app for Android or iOS. You can use almost any such app, and there are plenty of them. We recommend setting up two-factor authentication for your AdGuard account. It won't take you long, but it will help protect your license keys, subscriptions, and, most importantly, any personal information associated with the account. How to set it up Log into your AdGuard account and go to the Settings tab: Scroll down to Password and 2FA section and click Enable: Follow the on-screen instructions to install an authenticator app and scan the QR code: Important Save the second-factor backup code somewhere, it will be necessary to recover your account in case your mobile phone gets lost or stolen; If everything is done right, you will see this when you log into your account the next time: Use your mobile authenticator app to read the code and enter it. You should be logged in now! NOTE: If you get an authentication error, check the clock on your phone. Adjust it if needed, as an unsynchronized clock may be the cause of the error. "

30,"Currently existing problems Every year Apple releases a new version of macOS, introducing innovative solutions and adding new useful features. But some of them, such as Network Extensions API (Big Sur) or iCloud Private Relay (Monterey), cause some problems to many applications, AdGuard not being an exception. In this article we go over the known issues specific to each macOS version and possible ways to solve them. Monterey 12: currently existing problems These problems aren't fixed by Apple yet, or fixed only partially. Compatibility with iCloud Private Relay Currently, AdGuard and iCloud Private Relay cannot work at the same time. AdGuard has no ability to block ads because iCloud Private Relay encrypts traffic before AdGuard can filter network connections. When iCloud Private Relay is active, any filtering (including local filtering) becomes impossible. Thus, AdGuard can't filter traffic or perform DNS filtering in Safari. That's why by default, AdGuard uses the ""default route"" which disables iCloud Private Relay. For a deeper understanding of this problem, read this article. Recommended solution We recommend using AdGuard together with a more traditional VPN service such as AdGuard VPN. Alternative solution You can prevent AdGuard from using the ""default route"" by disabling it. It can be done via Advanced Settings → network.extension.monterey.force.split.tunnel. Note that enabling this setting will cause the problems described above. Compatibility with Protect Mail Activity Apple's Mail app now uses a proxy to hide a user's IP address when downloading images from emails. However, it won't work if there's an active VPN connection. As it treats AdGuard as a VPN, it won't preload images automatically. For a deeper understanding of this problem, read this article. Recommended solution At this point, we recommend using a more traditional VPN service, such as AdGuard VPN, instead of the new Apple's privacy features. Monterey 12, Big Sur 11.6 and later: currently existing problems These problems aren't fixed by Apple yet, or fixed only partially. Compatibility with Cisco AnyConnect AdGuard will not work together with Cisco AnyConnect while in the Network Extension mode. You have to switch AdGuard to Automatic Proxy mode. To do so, follow this instruction. Compatibility with Flutter This problem is solved in Flutter 2.2, released in June 2021. But to fix it for applications developed in Flutter, you need to wait for updates. If you use Flutter alongside AdGuard in ""Network Extension"" mode (or any other ""Transparent Proxy""-type app) in Monterey or Big Sur, you will run into problems: projects won't open and Flutter will be effectively broken. We have already reported this bug to Apple. Meanwhile, you can use these temporary solutions: Use AdGuard in Automatic Proxy mode. Disable SIP and switch AdGuard to Kernel Extension mode as explained here. VPN apps with legacy API Despite AdGuard is displayed as a VPN in system settings, it shouldn't cause any conflicts when working alongside other VPN-based apps. However, if you're using a VPN-based app that was downloaded from outside App Store, there's a chance it uses the old VPN API and you have to exclude it from filtering: Open AdGuard's menu. Select Preferences.... Switch to the Network tab. Click the Applications... button. Find the app you want to exclude and uncheck the checkbox next to it. Already fixed problems These problems have been fixed by Apple by now but can be encountered in the older versions of macOS Big Sur. Compatibility with Little Snitch 5 At this moment, Network Extension mode in AdGuard isn't compatible with Little Snitch 5. When both are running, there's a chance to encounter issues with various apps' behavior, even if they aren't filtered by AdGuard. This problem is directly caused by a bug in Big Sur, and we've already informed Apple about it. This leaves us to believe that this issue will get resolved in one of the next updates. It needs to be said that this problem can't be solved by disabling connections monitoring in Little Snitch, because this action doesn't unload Little Snitch's extension from the system. We recommend to switch to Automatic Proxy filtering mode when running AdGuard alongside with Little Snitch on Big Sur, at least until Apple fixes the bug. Compatibility with local proxies Note: now AdGuard can filter local proxies (mostly) without any problems. If you encounter any issues in OS versions 11.1+, or if you're using Big Sur 11.0, remove the local proxy from System settings and configure an upstream proxy in AdGuard by following the instruction below. To configure an upstream proxy in AdGuard for Mac in Big Sur, you need to go to AdGuard menu → Advanced → Advanced Settings.... Click on the Value area of the upstream.proxy setting to configure a proxy. Enter a string that looks like scheme://user:password@host:port, where scheme is either http, https, socks4 or socks5, depending on your proxy type, If you use socks5 proxy type, set the value of the upstream.proxy.socks5udp setting to true to make AdGuard route UDP traffic to the proxy server. user and password are corresponding username and password of your proxy (if needed). Ignore either or both when not applicable, host is the IP address of your proxy server, port is the desired port number to be used by the proxy server. Example: socks5://localhost:6322 will configure a SOCKS5 local proxy that listens to port 6322 and doesn't require a username or a password. Click Apply to make AdGuard route all traffic that went through it to the configured proxy server. If you run into any problems, please contact our tech support at support@adguard.com. Example 1: Configuring an upstream Shadowsocks proxy Here's an example of how to configure an upstream proxy for Shadowsocks. First of all, you need a working server side for your proxy. Most likely, to set it up, you would use a JSON file like this (server and password values were chosen randomly here): { ""server"":""111.222.333.444"", ""server_port"":8388, ""local_port"":1080, ""password"":""barfoo!"", ""timeout"":600, ""method"":""chacha20-ietf-poly1305"" } You can find more information about how to get started on Shadowsocks website. Then you'd have to install Shadowsocks client on your Mac. Make sure that you select 'Manual Mode' or 'Auto Mode' in its settings! The configuration won't work if you select 'Global Mode' (or 'Auto Mode' in Big Sur versions prior to 11.1). Now go to AdGuard menu → Advanced → Advanced Settings... and set the Value area of the upstream.proxy setting to socks5://localhost:1080. Notice that you need to use ""local_port"" value from the JSON file here. Because Shadowsocks uses SOCKS5, you also need to set the value of the upstream.proxy.socks5udp setting in AdGuard Advanced Settings to true to make AdGuard route UDP traffic to the proxy server. Example 2: Configuring an upstream Surge proxy In Big Sur v11.1+, there are no known conflicts between AdGuard and Surge proxy. If you are using an older version of Big Sur (prior to 11.1), check that System Proxy in the bottom right corner is disabled. Otherwise, Surge won't work with AdGuard. On the other hand, Enhanced Mode can be enabled without causing a conflict in any Big Sur version. Now go to AdGuard menu → Advanced → Advanced Settings... and set the Value area of the upstream.proxy setting to socks5://localhost:6153 or http://localhost:6152, depending on which type of proxy you want to use. Notice that you need to use port value that's indicated in the Events area of the Activity tab in your Surge client. If you chose SOCKS5 protocol, you also need to set the value of the upstream.proxy.socks5udp setting in AdGuard Advanced Settings to true to make AdGuard route UDP traffic to the proxy server. Alternatives to using a Network Extension It's impossible to foresee each and every possible problem that can pop up in Big Sur or Monterey, there are countless various hardware/software and settings configurations. If you face any compatibility issues, please contact our support team, but feel free to try one of these workarounds first. Using ""Automatic proxy"" filtering mode {#automatic-proxy} If you face problems in Big Sur or Monterey which can't be resolved by any of the methods above, you can try switching AdGuard to Automatic proxy mode. Open AdGuard's menu. Select Preferences.... Switch to the Network tab. Click the Select Mode... button. Select Automatic Proxy. Now AdGuard has automatically added a .pac file to your Mac's network settings, so that the system will consider AdGuard a proxy and try to send all traffic through AdGuard. Take into account that some apps may ignore this system setting and their traffic will not be filtered. Enabling Kernel Extension in Big Sur and Monterey {#kernel-extension} By default AdGuard uses Network Extension framework in Big Sur and Monterey as the old Kernel Extension framework is disabled there. This can cause some compatibility problems, but to enable Kernel Extension back, you need to disable System Integrity Protection (SIP) first. To disable SIP, follow this instruction: Click the Apple symbol in the Menu bar. Click Restart… Hold down Command-R to reboot into Recovery Mode. Click Utilities. Select Terminal. Type csrutil disable. Press Return or Enter on your keyboard. Click the Apple symbol in the Menu bar. Click Restart… Now that SIP is disabled, this is how you enable Kernel Extension: Open AdGuard's menu. Select Preferences.... Switch to the Network tab. Click the Select Mode... button. Select Kernel Extension. Confirm that you want to switch to Kernel Extension. However, we only recommend using this method if everything else fails, as this may lead to unexpected issues. "

32,"To filter netwrok traffic, AdGuard uses a network driver. There are two options: TDI driver and WFP driver. While WFP driver is generally preferrable and is enabled by default for all newer Windows OS versions (Windows 8 and newer), it can potentially cause compatibility problems, especially with some antiviruses. These problems and subsequent errors can be very different in each case. If you encounter a problem that you suspect might be caused by this, you can always switch to the older but more stable TDI network driver. To do so: Go to Settings → Network. Disable WFP driver as it’s done in this picture: "

34,"When discussing AdGuard ad filters, one topic often comes up – whether AdGuard should block this or that ad. By setting the rules, we stick to specific criteria that are very similar to EasyList Policy, which we find correct and appropriate. However, we have made some changes to it. Terminology Throughout this text, we use the terms first party and third party. A ""first party"" is a website that a user visits intentionally and knowingly, plus a set of resources on the web operated by the same organization. In practice, we consider resources to belong to the same party if they are part of the same registrable domain: a public suffix plus one additional label. Example: site.example, www.site.example, and s.u.b.site.example belong to the same party because site.example is their common registrable domain. A ""third party"" is any party that does not fall within the definition of the first party above. Interactions with other parties are considered third-party, even if the user is transiently informed in context (for example, in the form of a redirect). Merely hovering over, muting, pausing, or closing a given piece of content does not constitute an intention to interact. Common criteria These equally apply to rules in all filters. Rules that often cause problems with the work of some websites will be deleted. Website-specific rules will be added only if a website has sufficient traffic. Traffic is determined by open statistics (if available) or by other means, such as followers on social media. A website's traffic is considered sufficient when it has 100 thousand visits per month. We will consider adding a rule for a website that's not that popular, but the final decision is up to the filter list maintainer. Ad filters This part describes the AdGuard Base filter, the Mobile Ads filter, and the following language-specific filters: Russian, German, Dutch, Spanish/Portuguese, Japanese, Turkish, Chinese, and French. What shall these filters block? These filters will block ads wherever possible. Ads should be blocked regardless of their reasons and goals. We will block ads caused by malicious apps or extensions that inject ads. Please note that we do it only on the condition that you specify how to install such an app or extension. Limitations and Exceptions If a rule is subject to the list of limitations described below, then it won’t be added to the main filters. Websites’ own ads should not be removed on purpose. On the other hand, they should not be unblocked if it may cause third-party ads to reappear. Website-specific rules will be added only if a website has sufficient traffic. Traffic is determined by open statistics (if available) or by other means, such as followers on social media. A website's traffic is considered sufficient when it has 100 thousand visits per month. We will consider adding a rule for a website that's not that popular, but the final decision is up to the filter list maintainer. Anti-adblock scripts will be blocked only if they limit or affect the functionality of a website. Anti-adblock scripts will not be blocked in cases when it is prohibited by law. Rules that often cause problems with the work of some websites will be deleted. Tracking Protection filter What will be blocked with this filter? This filter will block all trackers that collect user personal data. We define tracking as collecting data regarding an individual’s identity or activity across one or more websites. Even if such data is considered to be personally unidentifiable, it’s still tracking. Tracker is an online script that has tracking as its only purpose, or as one of its purposes. Limitations and Exceptions If a rule is subject to the list of limitations described below, then it won’t be added to this filter. Rules that cause problems with website functionality will be removed. Website-specific rules will be added only if a website has sufficient traffic. Traffic is determined by open statistics (if available) or by other means, such as followers on social media. A website's traffic is considered sufficient when it has 100 thousand visits per month. We will consider adding a rule for a website that's not that popular, but the final decision is up to the filter list maintainer. AdGuard URL Tracking filter What will be blocked with this filter? This filter will strip all tracking parameters from URLs. We define tracking as collecting data regarding an individual’s identity or activity across one or more websites. Even if such data is considered to be personally unidentifiable, it’s still tracking. Limitations and Exceptions If a rule is subject to the list of limitations described below, then it won’t be added to this filter. Rules that would reduce user security levels will be removed. Rules that cause problems with website functionality will be removed. Website-specific rules will be added only if a website has sufficient traffic. Traffic is determined by open statistics (if available) or by other means, such as followers on social media. A website's traffic is considered sufficient when it has 100 thousand visits per month. We will consider adding a rule for a website that's not that popular, but the final decision is up to the filter list maintainer. Social Media filter What will be blocked with this filter? This filter will block social media widgets (on third-party websites) such as ""Like"" and ""Share"" buttons, recommendation widgets, and more. Limitations and Exceptions If a rule is subject to the list of limitations described below, then it won’t be added to this filter. Rules that block widgets that are a part of a website’s functionality, such as ""Comments,"" ""Embedded Post,"" ""Surveys,"" or widgets that require authorization via social networks. Rules that block links to a website’s communities in social networks. Rules that cause problems with website functionality will be removed. Website-specific rules will be added only if a website has sufficient traffic. Traffic is determined by open statistics (if available) or by other means, such as followers on social media. A website's traffic is considered sufficient when it has 100 thousand visits per month. We will consider adding a rule for a website that's not that popular, but the final decision is up to the filter list maintainer. Annoyances filter What will be blocked with this filter? This filter will block obstructions on the page. These elements are not ads, but they obstruct the view and make it difficult to see the actual content of the website. Such elements include cookie notices, third-party widgets, in-page pop-ups, email subscription forms, banners with special offers, and aggressively placed social media widgets. Limitations and Exceptions If a rule is subject to the list of limitations described below, then it won’t be added to this filter. Rules that block elements that are essential for the website functioning (e.g. authorization forms) will not be blocked even if they satisfy other requirements. Rules that cause problems with website functionality will be removed. Website-specific rules will be added only if a website has sufficient traffic. Traffic is determined by open statistics (if available) or by other means, such as followers on social media. A website's traffic is considered sufficient when it has 100 thousand visits per month. We will consider adding a rule for a website that's not that popular, but the final decision is up to the filter list maintainer. Filter unblocking search ads and self-promotion Unlike other filters, this one unblocks certain ads. Read more about it in the article on search ads and self-promotion. What will be unblocked with this filter? Search ads (ads that you see among the results when using an online search engine). Website self-promotion (when an ad on a website is promoting this very website or other websites/social media/etc closely related to it). Limitations and Exceptions Rules that cause problems with website functionality will be removed. Website-specific rules will be added only if a website has sufficient traffic. Traffic is determined by open statistics (if available) or by other means, such as followers on social media. A website's traffic is considered sufficient when it has 100 thousand visits per month. We will consider adding a rule for a website that's not that popular, but the final decision is up to the filter list maintainer. Quality requirements for filtering rules The rules should be as efficient as possible in terms of performance. Exception rules should be as specific as possible in order to avoid unnecessary unblocking. CSS and JS injection rules should be used as rarely as possible and only when it is impossible to block ads without them. "
35,"What is the integration mode? In older versions of AdGuard Browser extension, if you had it installed along with one of the AdGuard desktop apps (AdGuard for Windows or AdGuard for Mac), the extension took upon itself the functions of AdGuard Assistant — a tool that helped manage the filtering right from the web page. At the same time, the ad blocking itself was completely under of the desktop app's control, the extension and its settings played no role in that. The problem was, in some cases the app and the extension would hamper each other’s work. Some websites would stop being protected by the desktop program and were backed up only by the extension which has less possibilities. Thus, starting with AdGuard Browser Extension v3.5, the integration mode was removed. Instead, the new AdGuard Browser Assistant was implemented. AdGuard Browser Assistant AdGuard Browser Assistant is a new browser extension that works and feels just like the integration mode but much lighter, without redundant functions, and doesn't interfere with the desktop apps. You can read more about Browser Assistant for Windows or Mac, or download it from our website. AdGuard Browser Assistant is available in all major browsers. "
36,"For AdGuard to successfully filter HTTPS traffic in Firefox, the browser needs to trust AdGuard's certificate. It can be achieved differently for different versions of the Firefox. Method 1 This method works in Firefox for Android version 90.0 and later. To make Firefox trust the AdGuard certificate, do the following: Run the browser. Go to Settings → About Firefox. Tap the Firefox logo five times. Navigate to Settings → Secret Settings. Toggle Use third party CA certificates. Method 2 This method will only work on rooted devices. Install and configure adb; On the Windows platform, Samsung owners may need to install this utility. Activate the developer mode and enable USB debugging: Open the Settings app on your phone; Go to System section (last item in the settings menu). In this section, find the sub-item About phone; Tap the Build number line 7 times. After that, you will receive a notification that You are now a developer (If necessary, enter an unlock code for the device); Open System Settings → Developer Options → Scroll down and enable USB debugging → Confirm debugging is enabled in the window Allow USB debugging after reading the warning carefully. Install the Firefox browser (release version); Open the AdGuard settings → Network → HTTPS Filtering → Install the certificate in Firefox → INSTALL FOR OLD VERSIONS; Open the folder data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/mozilla using adb shell su and cd data/data/..., then browse to the folder named xxxxxxx.default and memorize its name; In the specified folder we are interested in two files: cert9.db key4.db We need to move these files to a folder of the browser where the security certificate issue occurred: data/data/org.mozilla.<browser_name>/files/mozilla/yyyyyy.default. The full command will look like this: adb shell su cp -R data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/mozilla/xxxxxxxxxx.default/cert9.db data/data/org.mozilla.<browser_name>/files/mozilla/yyyyyyyyyy.default cp -R data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/mozilla/xxxxxxxxxx.default/key4.db data/data/org.mozilla.<browser_name>/files/mozilla/yyyyyyyyyy.default In case you received the system notification permission denied, you should first move the specified files to the permission-free directory. And after that you should move them to the necessary folder in your Firefox browser. The full command should look something like this: adb shell su cp -R data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/mozilla/xxxxxxxx.default/cert9.db sdcard/Download cp -R data/data/org.mozilla.firefox/files/mozilla/xxxxxxxxx.default/key4.db sdcard/Download cp -R sdcard/Download/cert9.db data/data/org.mozilla.<browser_name>/files/mozilla/yyyyyyyyyy.default cp -R sdcard/Download/key4.db data/data/org.mozilla.<browser_name>/files/mozilla/yyyyyyyyyy.default If adb shell su does not work, you should try adb shell initially, and then su.

37,"To diagnose the reasons for potential problems that users might encounter while using AdGuard, the support team might need the process dump file. The dump file helps developers to see the processes that were executed in the application over a given period of time. Below you can check on the instructions of how to collect the dump file on your PC. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc and click Task Manager In the upper menu bar select Details Right-click the process that you want to create the dump file for (for example, the support team may ask you to create a dump for Adguard.exe) In the drop-down menu click Create dump file The file was created successfully! After you’ve created the dump file, please navigate to the file location. You should be prompted to open the folder containing the dump file right after its creation. Otherwise, you will be able to find it inside the %tmp% folder. The created dump file (.DMP) has the same name as the name of the process you chose in the previous steps. The file is quite large, so please compress it into an archive before sending to support. Please note, AdGuard for Windows has two running processes (Adguard.exe and AdguardSvc.exe). So you need to create the dump file separately for each process. When you send the dump files to the support team, please also attach the AdGuard application logs so we have a better chance at solving the problem. Here you can check the instructions on how to collect the log file. "
38,"What an AdGuard account is AdGuard account is a user account that stores information about your AdGuard licenses and subscriptions, active devices, your purchase history, preferred language, and other preferences. Many AdGuard products offer an option to activate them by entering the credentials for your AdGuard account, provided it contains a valid license. How to create an account To create an account, go to AdGuard's official website and press the My Account button on the top right corner of the screen. Enter your email address and create a password — your account will be registered. If you enter your email address while purchasing a license or receive a license accociated with your email address as a gift, an account will be created automatically. To set a password, you can follow a link from a transactional or gift letter. You can also register with the above method. An account can also be created directly in an AdGuard app. Press the Log in or Activate button (it can be found in the License section or on a separate screen), enter your email and create a password. After the account is created, activate it by following the link in the activation email. "
39," Last update: September 20, 2022 Understanding this article may require some basic knowledge about encryption, TLS, and HTTPS. First, look at this simple diagram that shows the general structure of the HTTPS protocol: AdGuard copies properties of the TLS connection that your browser uses: AdGuard uses the same TLS version AdGuard uses the same encrypting methods (ciphers) as your browser Effectively, it means that if you use a modern, safe browser, it will take all known TLS problems into account and won’t attempt to use unsafe ciphers. What does AdGuard do when there are any doubts about the certificate’s validity? In such cases, AdGuard entirely ceases filtering of all connections to this domain and leaves the browser in charge of all decisions. Known issues HTTPS filtering in AdGuard has its drawbacks. Almost all of them are scheduled to be eliminated in the next few AdGuard versions. All the issues known to us and the ETAs on their fixes are listed below. Inspecting the original certificate The most important drawback of the HTTPS filtering mechanism is that it hides the real certificate of a website. You cannot simply check its original certificate because you can only see the one issued by AdGuard. This problem is solved in Browser Assistant. This browser extension helps you manage filtering directly from the browser and allows you to inspect the original certificate of any website. Certificate Transparency Thanks to modern cryptography, browsers can usually detect malicious websites that are provisioned with forged or fake SSL certificates. However, current cryptographic mechanisms aren’t so good at detecting malicious websites if they’re provisioned with mistakenly issued certificates or certificates that have been issued by a certificate authority (CA) that’s been compromised or gone rogue. Certificate Transparency aims to remedy these certificate-based threats by making the issuance and existence of SSL certificates open to scrutiny by domain owners, CAs, and domain users. AdGuard products which use CoreLibs starting with version 1.11 will implement a policy based on Chrome Certificate Transparency Policy. Have remarks or suggestions? If you’d like to add something, report any errors, or ask a question, please contact us at: devteam@adguard.com. "
40,"How to block ads on YouTube in Safari Unfortunately, ad blocking in the YouTube app is technically impossible, but if you watch YouTube in Safari, there is a way. We developed an action extension (available since AdGuard v4.2 for iOS) designed specifically to block ads there. After you update your app to v4.2, this extension will be installed automatically, you don't have to follow any complicated instructions. Other than ads, the extension removes the placeholder remaining after blocking on iPads. Plus, YouTube videos are played automatically again and you don't have to make an extra tap. To activate the extension and block ads on YouTube, do the following: Open youtube.com in Safari. Tap the Share button. Tap ""Block YouTube Ads (by AdGuard)"". YouTube is now ad-free! Please note that you need to run this extension again if you reload the page. In some cases the AdGuard extension may be not displayed. If you don't see it, try to follow the instruction again or restart your device "
41,"When using ad blockers, you may face incorrect work of certain websites or broken page elements. These problems might arise due to a variety of factors: Incorrect user rules; Modified algorithms of adding ads; Added filters/extensions from third-party developers; The authors of one of the filters made a mistake when creating the rule; Advertising reinsertion. Find more about this method in our blog. You can help us by filling in an application form with examples of ads you faced with. To do it, please, use instructions for your OS. Report a website {#report} Note: When you send a complaint via the app or via AdGuard Browser Assistant, all information is pre-filled automatically. Except for the screenshots, you'll have to make and attach them yourself. If you're using a direct link, you’ll need to enter data manually.

Filling in the form starts with detailing the type and version of a product; Specify the type of problem and additional information on using third-party software (antivirus, VPN); Enter the address of the page and the browser (or the download link in case of an app) where you've encountered a problem; Application configuration must be specified: Filters you use; Stealth mode settings, if this function is enabled. Provide a screenshot that captures the essence of a problem; Important: Hide your personal information (email, phone number, etc.) because screenshots will become publicly available. Provide additional information that will help filter developers understand the situation; Also enter your account on GitHub, if available (it's necessary for developers to be able to reach you in case they need some additional details); Check each step before sending the form; You'll be provided with a link to track progress on your task. Diagnosis of an issue {#issue} This option is suitable for those who aren’t afraid of difficulties and don’t mind trying to find the problem on their own. This does not require any special skills or in-depth knowledge of HTML and CSS. For example, you are faced with a situation that your favorite website won’t open, authorization has broken, or some page elements are displayed incorrectly. The cause may be using a specific filter/extension/Stealth Mode setting. To diagnose these problems, you need to do the following: Filters Disable Ad Blocker; If it solved the problem, re-enable the module and disable filters one by one. This is done to identify filters that ""break"" the page; If you have managed to find out which filter ""breaks"" a page, you should inform the developers when filling out the form (see above). In this case, it is desirable to return to the initial settings; If turning off all the filters hasn't produced any results, apply rule @@||example.com^$document,extension; where example.com is an example site name that needs to be replaced by your own option; In case of failure (issue not solved), turn to section Stealth Mode. Stealth Mode Disable Stealth Mode; If this solved the problem, turn the module on and turn off the Stealth Mode options one by one. This is done to detect which filters are ""breaking"" the page; If you have managed to to detect which setting ""breaks"" a page, you should inform the developers when filling out the form (see above). In this case, it is desirable to return to the initial settings; In case of failure (issue not solved), turn to section Extensions. Extensions Disable Extensions; If this solved the problem, turn on the module and turn off Extensions settings one by one. This is done to find out which setting ""breaks"" the page; If you have managed to detect which setting ""breaks"" a page, inform the developers when filling out the form (see above). In this case, it is desirable to return to the initial settings. Third-party blockers Some browsers and antivirus programs (such as Yandex Browser, Kaspersky, etc.) have built-in ad blockers. They may affect and cause problems in the operation of sites. If you use such programs, make sure that the problem is on the side of AdGuard: disable AdGuard filtering and try to repeat the problem. If it remains, it means that the problem is caused by another application or browser. If the problem is caused by AdGuard, follow the steps described in the previous paragraphs. "
42,"What are HAR files? The HAR (HTTP ARchive) format is a JSON-formatted archive file for logging of a web browser's interaction with a site. The specifications of HAR format defines an archival data for HTTP transactions that used by a browser to export detailed information about web pages it loads. More detailed description of HAR file format and its specification you can find at softwareishard.com website. How to get HAR files Sometimes we need to analyze it to block specific ads that are difficult to reproduce for some reason. To get HAR files follow these steps: Open AdGuard and go to ""Settings"". Choose ""Advanced"" in the menu. Choose ""Low Level Settings"". Activate ""pref.har.capture"" (you will have to restart the protection). Now reproduce the problem - open the app, perform the necessary actions to make the ad appear. Now turn ""pref.har.capture"" off again. Go back and tap ""Export logs and system info"" → Save. Please send the file with logs (that you've got as a result) to the AdGuard support service. Note: Our support team will process your ticket much faster if you specify the HelpDesk ticket number or the GitHub issue number in your message. How to analyze HAR files Here are some sources that we can recommend to analyze HAR files: HTTP Archive Viewer master is a HAR analyzer tool, visualizes HTTP Archive (HAR) log files created by HTTP tracking tools. Fiddler is a web debugging proxy, lets you capture, inspect, monitor all HTTP(S) traffic between your computer and the Internet, mock requests, and diagnose network issues. "
43,"How to reach the Low-level settings Changing Low-level settings can cause problems with the performance of AdGuard, may break the Internet connection or compromise your security and privacy. You should only open this section if you are sure of what you are doing or our support-team has asked you about it. To go to Low-level settings, open the main menu, tap Settings, choose Advanced and find Low-Level Settings at the bottom of the screen. Low-level settings pref.boot.startup.delay Here you can set AdGuard’s startup delay after device boot-up (in seconds). This setting is only relevant if AdGuard autostart is enabled (Settings → General → AdGuard autostart). pref.dns.blocking.type Here you can select the way AdGuard will respond to blocked DNS queries: 0 — means block requests with Refused response code for Network filtering rules and with Unspecified IP for Host rules. 1 — means block requests with NXDomain for all kinds of filtering rules. 2 — means block requests with Unspecified IP for all kinds of filtering rules. 3 — means block requests with Unspecified IP for all kinds of filtering rules. 4 — means block requests with Refused response code for all kinds of filtering rules. 1 is used by default if the entered value is not valid. pref.dns.bootstrap Bootstrap DNS for DoH, DoT, and DoQ servers. The System DNS server is used by default. pref.dns.detect.search.domains If enabled AdGuard detects search domains and automatically forwards them to the fallback upstreams if they exist. pref.dns.fallback Here you can specify a fallback DNS resolver that will be used when the configured server is not available. If not specified, the system default DNS is used as a fallback. A string ""none"" means no fallback at all. pref.dns.fallback.domains Here you can list domains that will be directly forwarded to the fallback upstreams (if they exist). pref.dns.timeout Here you can specify a timeout in milliseconds to be used for each DNS request. Please note that if you are using multiple upstreams, the fallback DNS resolver will only be used after all the timeouts of each upstream. pref.enforce.https.filtering Here are already listed package names of apps for which AdGuard enforces HTTPS filtering. You can add this list with any app even if it targets Android 7+. But before check if the application trusts the AdGuard’s HTTPS certificate, which is located in the User storage, or the developers have not provided such an option. pref.enforce.paused.notification Enforce notification about paused protection even when the notification icon is set to Disabled (for Android below Oreo). pref.excluded.packages Here you can list the packages and UIDs you want to exclude from filtering. pref.filtered.ports Here you can list the ports connections to which will be filtered. pref.har.capture Here you can enable HAR file capture. Use it only for debugging purposes! If the setting is enabled, AdGuard will create a directory named ""har"" inside the app cache directory. It contains information about all filtered HTTP requests in HAR 1.2 format and can be analyzed with the Fiddler program. pref.https.ignored.errors For the domains and package names listed here, notifications that they do not trust AdGuard's HTTPS certificate will be disabled. pref.https.opportunistic If enabled, AdGuard will bypass the traffic of any app that does not trust our certificate. It is enabled by default. pref.ipv4.routs.excluded Here you can find the list of IPv4 ranges excluded from filtering. For instance, we don’t filter connections to the private IP ranges. You can add this list if required. pref.ipv6.routs.excluded Here you can list the IPv6 ranges which you want to exclude from filtering. pref.notify.on.unknown.ca If enabled, AdGuard shows you a notification if any app doesn’t trust our HTTPS certificate. pref.proxy.block.ipv6 If enabled, AdGuard blocks all Internet connections through IPv6 when working in ""Proxy with automatic setup"" mode. pref.proxy.disable.reconfigure Here you can disable AdGuard automatic root proxy reconfiguration when network connectivity changes. pref.quic.bypass.packages Here you can list packages for which AdGuard will bypass QUIC traffic. pref.removed.html.log If enabled, AdGuard shows information about blocked HTML elements in the filtering log. pref.root.clear.youtube If enabled, AdGuard clears YouTube app data on booting to block YouTube ads. Root access is required. pref.root.set.oom_adj If enabled, AdGuard sets the minimum oom_score_adj for its own process to stay alive all the time. Requires root access. pref.samsungpay.autopause.enable If enabled, AdGuard pauses protection when you open the Samsung Pay app. Requires usage access. pref.vpn.android10.mitigate If enabled, AdGuard applies a workaround solution that mitigates the soft reboots issue caused by an Android 10 bug. pref.vpn.capture If enabled, AdGuard will create the special file name ""tun.pcap"".

This file is located in the app cache directory and can be analyzed with the Wireshark program. pref.vpn.disable.pause This feature disables automatic VPN pause in case of network absence, tethering, or power-saving mode. pref.vpn.disable.reconfigure This feature disables VPN automatic reconfiguration in case of network absence, tethering, or power-saving mode. pref.vpn.ipv4.address TUN interface IPv4 address. pref.vpn.ipv4.bypass If enabled, VPN will be configured to bypass all the IPv4 traffic. In this case, IPv4 will work, but it will not be filtered. pref.vpn.ipv4.force.complex If enabled, VPN will bypass the LAN when possible. However, for complex networks, the LAN is not excluded and connections will be filtered, including local ones. pref.vpn.ipv4.force.default This feature disables the routes we use to exclude LAN from filtering. pref.vpn.ipv6.address TUN interface IPv6 address. pref.vpn.ipv6.bypass If enabled, VPN will be configured to bypass all the IPv6 traffic. In this case, IPv6 will work, but it will not be filtered. pref.vpn.ipv6.disable This feature forcibly disables filtering for IPv6 networks. In this case, IPv6 will not work at all. pref.vpn.ipv6.force This feature forcibly enables filtering for IPv6 networks. The app doesn’t filter IPv6 on Lollipop and some cell carriers by default. pref.vpn.tun.mtu Here you can set the maximum transmission unit (MTU) of the VPN interface. The recommended interval for the experiments is from 1500 to 9000. Reset You always can reset Low-level settings to default. "
44,"AdGuard Assistant’s primary function is to manage filtering directly from the browser. It has existed for quite a long time, and its form and content have changed. More precisely, it used to be a mere userscript incorporated into AdGuard for Windows app and became a full-fledged browser extension. Now it yields more benefits. Benefits Independence AdGuard Browser Assistant is a browser extension, it is installed in a browser, so there is no need to wait for the userscript to be injected into the filtered web page, as it was with the preceding one. In other words, it is more autonomous from the main AdGuard app. Still, Browser Assistant needs the installed AdGuard for Windows, because there is no point in using the extension without the app. Compatibility with the main app If you got into the habit of using our previous AdGuard Ad Blocker extension in Integration mode, you may like the solution that we have developed for the new Browser Assistant. Background information: In previous versions of the AdGuard Browser Extension (before v3.5), if you had it installed along with the AdGuard for Windows app, the extension took over the functions of Assistant, stopped filtering itself and relied on the app to do this. The extension and the app worked in conjunction but sometimes the integration would fail. Some websites would stop being protected by the desktop program and be backed up only by the less powerful extension. When using the Browser Assistant, all these problems don’t matter as there can be no conflicts in essence. The role of the Browser Assistant is well-defined and it can’t hinder the functioning of the main app, so there is no need to worry. Separate tab in settings The new Browser Assistant has its own tab in AdGuard for Windows settings, along with Stealth Mode, Browsing Security, Parental Control and others. There you will find a link to download the extension for your default browser. Besides, there is a checkbox to enable the legacy Assistant. Legacy Assistant Legacy Assistant is the previous version of Assistant, which is a mere userscript, not a browser extension. Basically, there are two cases when you might want to pick it instead of the new Browser Assistant: 1) the new Assistant is not available for your browser; 2) you are used to the green shield icon and want to leave things as they were. How to install AdGuard Browser Assistant If you want to install the Browser Assistant for your default browser, you can do it directly from the app settings, but you also have an opportunity to install it for other browsers. AdGuard Browser Assistant is available for all popular browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, and Yandex. To install the one you need (or many, it is not prohibited but even encouraged), go to our website, click the browser icon and tap the Install button. That’s it! "
45,"Desktop AdGuard apps (AdGuard for Windows and AdGuard for Mac) can be used as a proxy. This means that you can route other devices' traffic through AdGuard (entirely, or traffic of specific apps/browsers). Note that these devices must be in the same network as the PC or Mac on which AdGuard is installed. HTTP traffic will be filtered in any case, but for AdGuard to be able to filter HTTPS traffic you need to manually install AdGuard certificate on the connected device. How to download and install the certificate Depending on the operation system of your device (Windows/Mac/Android/iOS), follow one of these instructions: Windows {#windows} Note the IP address of your desktop computer with installed AdGuard. Make sure the AdGuard protection is enabled. Then check the box Use AdGuard as an HTTP proxy in the Network tab of its settings. On the same device with AdGuard follow this link using any browser: http://local.adguard.org/cert. Click the Download button. Transfer the downloaded cert.cer file to the device which traffic you want to route through AdGuard. On that device, press the Win button, type Manage computer certificates and press Enter.

46,"Many people choose Android because they like customizing settings and want to control their device completely. And it's totally normal if some of AdGuard users are not satisfied with its default behavior. Let's say, you want protection to stop when a certain app is launched, and then restart it again when the app is closed. This is a job for the Tasker app. AdGuard interface There are a lot of tasker apps out there, for example Tasker, AutomateIt etc. AdGuard provides an interface that allows these apps to setup various automation rules. Thanks to this interface, any app can send a special message (called ""intent"") that contains the name of the action and some additional data, if needed. AdGuard will look at this intent and perform the required actions. Security concerns Wouldn't it be a bit dangerous, you might ask — to let some random apps manage what AdGuard does? It would, and that's why a password is sent along with the intent. This password will be generated by AdGuard automatically, but you can, of course, change it at any time. Available actions So, ready to get your hands dirty? Here are actions that, when included in the intent, will be understood by AdGuard: start starts the protection, no extra data is needed; stop stops the protection, no extra data required; pause pauses the protection. The difference between this and stop is that a notification will appear that restarts the protection when you tap it. No extra data required; update checks for available filter and app updates, no additional data is needed; dns_filtering turns DNS filtering on and off. Requires an extra flag: enable:true or enable:false enables or disables DNS filtering, accordingly. dns_server switches between DNS servers, you need to include additional data: server:adguard dns switches to AdGuard DNS server; Note: the full list of supported provider names can be found inside AdGuard DNS settings under the ""Custom DNS settings"" server:custom switches to the previously added server named custom; server:tls://dns.adguard.com creates a new server and switches to it if the previously added servers and providers don't contain a server with the same address. Otherwise, it switches to the respective server. You can add server addresses as IP ( regular DNS), sdns://… (DNSCrypt or DNS-over-HTTPS), https://… (DNS-over-HTTPS) or tls://... (DNS-over-TLS); server:1.1.1.1, tls://1.1.1.1 creates a server with comma separated addresses and switches to it. When adding a server via server:1.1.1.1, tls://1.1.1.1, the previously added server is removed. server:system resets DNS settings to default system DNS servers. proxy_state enables/disables the outbound proxy. Requires an extra flag: enable:true or enable:false activates or deactivates the outbound proxy, accordingly. proxy_default sets the proxy from the list of previously added ones as default or creates a new one if server has not been added before. You need to specify additional data: server:[name] where [name] is the name of the outbound proxy from the list. Or you can configure server parameters manually: server:[type=…&host=…&port=…&username=…&password=…&udp=…&trust=…]. proxy_remove removes the proxy server from the list of previously added ones. server:[name] where [name] is the name of the outbound proxy from the list. Or you can configure remove parameters manually: server:[type=…&host=…&port=…&username=…&password=…&udp=…&trust=…]. Compulsory parameters: [type] — proxy server type: HTTP; SOCKS4; SOCKS5; HTTPS_CONNECT. [host] — outbound proxy domain or IP address; [port] — outbound proxy port (integer number from 1 to 65535); Optional parameters: [login and password] — only if proxy requires it. This data is ignored when setting up SOCKS4; [udp] applied only on SOCKS5 server type and include option UDP through SOCKS5. It is necessary to set true or false value; [trust] applies for HTTPS_CONNECT server type only and include option Trust any certificates. It is necessary to set true or false value. Example: setting by name: server:MyServer manually settings: server:host=1.2.3.4&port=80&type=SOCKS5&username=foo&password=bar&udp=true Don't forget to include the password as an extra and mention package name and class! You need to do so for every intent! Extra: password:******* Package name: com.adguard.android Class: com.adguard.android.receiver.AutomationReceiver Note: Before v4.0 the class was called com.adguard.android.receivers.AutomationReceiver but then we changed its name to com.adguard.android.receiver.AutomationReceiver. If you used this feature, please pay attention and use the new name. Execution without notification To perform a task without showing a toast, add an additional EXTRA quiet: true Example "
47,"AdGuard has two Android apps: AdGuard for Android and AdGuard Content Blocker. AdGuard for Android has a much wider range of functionality: it blocks ads, trackers, and annoyances in browsers and apps, uses filters as well as domain-level ad blocking, and supports user rules. AdGuard Content Blocker has a limited functionality. Full-fledged ad blockers can’t be introduced to Google Play due to the policy of the store. Google Play has banned ""apps that block or interfere with another app displaying ads"". Thus, AdGuard for Android can be downloaded on AdGuard's official website only. As an alternative, Google offers to developers the Content blocking API. The API has strict limitations and is currently supported by two browsers: Yandex Browser and Samsung Internet browser. Many complex filtering rules supported in other AdGuard products don't work with this API. AdGuard Content Blocker was designed to fit the Google Play policy framework. Compared to other AdGuard products, AdGuard Content Blocker has less ad blocking capabilities: AdGuard Content Blocker works only in browsers that support the content blocking technology. Currently, there are two: Yandex Browser and Samsung Internet browser. Within the existing technology, the functionality of AdGuard Content Blocker is limited: for example it cannot block ads and trackers in apps or other browsers, has no filtering log and doesn't support filtering at the domain level. However, AdGuard Content Blocker has 35 filters that allow you to block ads, trackers, and annoyances in two supported browsers. You can also customize ad blocking by selecting appropriate language-specific filters or adding user rules. AdGuard Content Blocker is a free open-source software. Its source code is available on GitHub. For a better and more customizable ad blocking experience, try using the full-fledged Android app. AdGuard for Android can be downloaded from our website. "
48,"One of the most popular questions users ask us is: 'Is it possible to block ads in YouTube on Android?'. Due to the technical restrictions of the Android OS, there is no way to completely remove ads from the YouTube app. But we've found an alternative that brings you to it as close as possible, while getting around the Android-imposed restrictions. Watch YouTube in the AdGuard app Open the YouTube app and start the video you want to watch. Tap the Share button and select AdGuard for Android from the list of apps. That's it! A new window with the video will open where you'll be able to watch it without being interrupted by ads. You can also watch YouTube in a browser and there will be no ads if you have AdGuard installed and enabled. "

51,"General Instruction For troubleshooting problems with crashes a regular log is almost always not enough. In such cases to identify the origin of the problem we need the system log. Below is the instruction how to collect and get it. Capture a bug report from a device To get a bug report directly from your device, do the following: Be sure you have Developer Options enabled. In Developer options, tap Take bug report. Select the type of bug report you want and tap Report. After a moment you get a notification that the bug report is ready (see figure 2). To share the bug report, tap the notification. Send this log to our support team. Note: Our support team will process your ticket much faster if you specify the HelpDesk ticket number or the GitHub issue number in your message to support. Additional Instruction (for old Android versions) On old Android devices there is no such option to take a bug report automatically. It has to be done manually by following this instruction: Part #1: prepare the device Switch device to the developer mode. To do this: go to Settings → About → tap Build Number 7 times. Go to Developer Options. Enable USB debugging. Increase Logger buffer sizes to 4MB per log buffer. 4MB should be enough for storing the logs we need until you're able to do the second part (getting log from the device); Important: you need to reproduce the problem after you've done with the first part! Part #2: get the log Connect your device to PC with USB cable. Download and install Minimal ADB: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2317790 Direct download link: https://www.androidfilehost.com/?fid=24052804347803384 Run this command in the console (it will be opened after install): adb logcat -v threadtime -d > C:\logcat.txt Send this log to us by contacting support or by any other way. Alternative way for ROOT users: Download and run Logcat. Choose Record in the menu. Choose a name for a log file or just press OK. Now you can press Home button, CatLog will continue recording the log in background. Reproduce the issue. Open CatLog and press Stop record in the menu. Send this log to our support team. Note: Our support team will process your ticket much faster if you specify the HelpDesk ticket number or the GitHub issue number in your message to support. "
52,"It turned out that Full-Tunnel mode might interfere not only with compatibility with other VPN applications, but also with FaceTime. Some users have encountered the problem that FaceTime does not work on the device when the AdGuard app for iOS is in Full-Tunnel mode. It is likely but not guaranteed that FaceTime will work when AdGuard is in Full-Tunnel mode without VPN icon because it is also incompatible with other VPN apps and unstable. If you want to use FaceTime and make sure that video/audio calls don't stop working, use Split-Tunnel mode. To enable it, follow the instructions: Go to AdGuard for iOS Settings → General settings. Enable Advanced mode and go to the Advanced settings section that appears right after. Open Tunnel mode and select Split-Tunnel. Done! Now there should be no problems with FaceTime compatibility. "
53,"Many websites gather information about their visitors, such as their IP address, installed browser and operating system, screen resolution, and even the page from which a visitor was redirected. Some web pages use cookies to mark your browser and save your personal settings and preferences, or to ""recognize"" you upon your next visit. Stealth Mode safeguards your personal information from such data- and statistics-gathering systems. You can flexibly adjust the work of Stealth Mode: for instance, you can prohibit the website from receiving the search request you used to find it on the Internet, automatically delete both third-party and the website's own cookies, turn off browser geolocation sharing that can be used to track your whereabouts, and hide your true IP address or even replace it with an arbitrary one. Below we will list and describe the main features and options that you can control in the Stealth Mode settings. They are split into four groups: General, Tracking methods, Browser API, and Miscellaneous. Some options may not be available depending on the particular product due to OS or other limitations. General {#general} Hide your search queries {#searchqueries} When you get directed to a website from Google, Yahoo, or any other search engine, this option hides the search query that you used to find that website. Send Do-Not-Track header {#donottrack} It sends a Do-Not-Track (DNT) HTTP header to queried websites, thus requiring web apps to disable tracking of your activity. Strip tracking parameters from URLs If you enable this option, AdGuard will strip tracking parameters like utm_* and fb_ref from pages’ URLs. Tracking methods {#tracking-methods} Self-destructing third-party cookies {#3p-cookie} Websites use cookies to store your information and preferences, such as the language you selected, your location, or the list of items in your shopping cart. When you return to a website, your browser sends back the cookies belonging to that website, which allows it to ""remember"" your data. Third-party cookies are those implemented by a website that is different from the one you are currently browsing. For example, cnn.com may have a Facebook ""Like"" widget on its homepage. This widget will implement a cookie that may be read later by Facebook. Some advertisers use such cookies to track what other sites you visit where their ads are placed. Set a time period (in minutes) at the end of which all third-party cookies will be destroyed. Set the timer to 0 to block them completely. Self-destructing first-party cookies {#1p-cookie} We do not recommend enabling this option as it may severely interfere with the work of certain sites. Set a time period (in minutes) at the end of which all cookies will be destroyed. Set the timer to 0 to block them completely. Disable cache for third-party requests {#3p-cache} When a browser addresses a page, the server assigns an ETag to that page. This ETag is used by the browser to cache the page's contents. Upon subsequent requests, the browser sends the ETag to the corresponding server, thus letting the server learn the visitor’s identity. As long as the site's files are cached, the ETag is sent every time your browser addresses this site. If the site has embedded content from another server (such as an image or iframe), that server can track your activities without your knowledge. Block third-party Authorization header {#3p-auth} ""Authorization"" header value is cached by the browser, and then is sent alongside every request to that domain. It means that it can be used for tracking purposes just like cookies. Browser API {#browser-api} Block WebRTC {#webrtc} WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a technology that allows direct streaming of data between browsers and apps. It can let others know your true IP address, even if you use a proxy or VPN. Enabling this option can disrupt the work of certain browser applications, such as messengers, chats, cinemas, or games. Block Push API {#push} The Push API enables servers to send messages to web applications regardless of the activity status of your browser. Thus, you may see notifications from various websites even if your browser is hidden in the tray or not launched. Enable this option to block the browser's Push API completely. Block Location API {#location} Enabling this option will prevent the browser from sending GPS data that could be used to determine your location, modify your search results, or otherwise influence your web experience. Block Flash {#flash} The Flash Player plugin has become increasingly vulnerable to such online threats as viruses and hackers; it may also significantly affect website loading time. Turning this setting on makes AdGuard block browsers' ability to detect components (such as plugins and ActiveXObject objects) that allow Flash to display content. This effectively means that browsers are unable to support Flash. Block Java {#java} Some websites and web services still use the old technology to support Java plugins. The Java plugin API, which is the basis of Java plugins, has serious security flaws. For security purposes, you can disable such plugins. Nevertheless, even if you decide to use the ""Block Java"" option, JavaScript will still be enabled. Miscellaneous {#miscellaneous} Hide Referrer from third parties {#referrer} Referrer is an HTTP header used in browser-to-server requests. It contains the URL of the request source. When you navigate from one page to another, Referrer saves the URL of the initial page. The server that hosts the destination web page often has software that parses Referrer and extracts various pieces of information from it. Enabling the Hide Referrer from third-parties option hides the current website from third-party sites by altering the HTTP header. You can also set an arbitrary value for Referrer by entering it into the Custom Referrer field. To use default Referrer, leave the field blank. Note that to be able to filter traffic, AdGuard applications 'intercept' browser-to-server requests. Requests to ad, tracking, and phishing servers may be altered before sending them to the server or blocked completely. Same goes for the Hide Referrer from third parties option: AdGuard intercepts HTTP(S) requests, in particular to remove or change the Referrer header if this option is enabled. However, it happens only after these requests “leave” the browser. This means that if you monitor Referrer inside the browser (for example, with the help of Chrome's Developer Tools), you will see the original Referrer because the request hasn't reached AdGuard yet. You can use software like Fiddler to make sure that Referrer gets altered correctly. On the opposite, due to the nature of all browser extensions, AdGuard Browser extension works 'inside' the browser. It will alter the Referrer right then and there, so Developer Tools will show the desired Referrer for your requests. Hide your User-Agent {#useragent} When you visit a website, your browser sends its information to the server. It looks like a text line that is part of an HTTP request that begins with ""User-Agent:"". It usually includes the name and version of the browser, the operating system, and language settings. We cut User-Agent from identifying information so that advertisers cannot obtain it. You can also set an arbitrary value for User-Agent by entering it into the Custom User-Agent field. To use default User-Agent, leave the field blank. Hide your IP address {#ip} Stealth Mode cannot hide your IP address. However, we can conceal it so that websites you visit will think you are a proxy. Sometimes this helps, and websites ignore your true IP address. You can set an arbitrary IP address, which you would like others to perceive as yours, by simply entering it into the corresponding field. To use the default IP address, leave the field blank. Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests {#xclientdata} It forbids Google Chrome from sending its version and modification information with requests to Google domains (including Double Click and Google Analytics). Protect from DPI {#dpi} The Deep Packet Inspection is a system of deep analysis and filtering of traffic by packet content, as well as the accumulation of statistical data. Using this technology, ISPs have the ability to control the passing traffic and limit access to content for their clients. AdGuard can modify outgoing packet data so that the client does not fall under the DPI blocking criteria. This means that by enabling this option, users can get access to the content they want. Not all DPI systems can be bypassed at this time, but we are constantly working to improve this. The ""Protect from DPI"" feature is already implemented in AdGuard for Windows, AdGuard for Mac, and AdGuard for Android. "
54,"Web extensions add custom functionality to Safari. You can find more information about Web extensions here. AdGuard's Safari Web extension is a tool that takes advantage of the new features of iOS 15. It serves to enhance the capabilities of AdGuard for iOS. With it, AdGuard can apply advanced filtering rules and ultimately block more ads. What it does By default, Safari provides only basic tools to content blockers. These tools don't allow the level of performance that can be found in content blockers on other operating systems (Windows, Mac, Android). For example, AdGuard apps on other platforms can use such effective weapons against ads as CSS rules, CSS selectors, and scriptlets. Unfortunately, these instruments are absolutely irreplaceable when dealing with more complex cases such as pre-roll ads on YouTube, for example. AdGuard's Safari Web extension compliments AdGuard by giving it the ability to employ these types of filtering rules. Besides that, AdGuard's Safari Web extension can be used to quickly manage AdGuard for iOS right from the browser. Tap the Extensions button — it's the one with a jigsaw icon, depending on your device type it may be located to the left or to the right of the address bar. Find AdGuard in the list and tap it. On iPads AdGuard's Safari Web extension is accessible directly by tapping the AdGuard icon in the browser's address bar. You will see the following list of options: Enabling/disabling protection on the website. Turning the switch off will disable AdGuard completely for the current website and add a respective exclusion rule. Turning the switch back on will resume protection for the website and delete the rule. Any such change will require some time to take effect. Blocking elements on the page manually. Tap the Block elements on this page button to prompt a pop-up for element blocking. Select any element on the page you want to hide, adjust the selection zone, then preview changes and confirm the removal. A corresponding filtering rule will be added to AdGuard (that you can later disable or delete to revert the change). Report an issue. Swipe up to bring out the Report an issue button. Use it to report a missed ad or any other problem that you encountered on the current page. How to enable AdGuard's Safari Web extension In the iOS settings AdGuard's Safari Web extension greatly improves the ad blocking quality, so we recommend enabling it on all sites. Web extension is not a standalone tool and requires AdGuard for iOS. If you don't have AdGuard for iOS installed on your device, please install it first and complete the onboarding process to prepare it for work. Once done, open Settings → Safari → Extensions. Find ALLOW THESE EXTENSIONS section and then find AdGuard among the available extensions. Tap it, then turn on the switch. On the same screen make sure that the AdGuard extension has required permissions: All Websites should have the Allow status. AdGuard's Safari Web extension requires access to the web pages' content to operate, but doesn't use it for any purpose other than blocking ads. In Safari Alternitavely, you can also turn AdGuard extension on from the Safari browser. Tap the Extensions button (if you don't see it next to the address bar, tap the aA icon). Then find the Manage Extensions option in the list and tap it. In the opened window turn on the switch next to AdGuard. If you use this method, you may have to go to Safari settings to grant AdGuard extension the necessary permissions anyway. You should now be able to see AdGuard among the available extensions. Tap it and then the yellow i icon. Enable Advanced protection by tapping the Turn on button and confirming the action. If you use AdGuard for iOS without Premium subscription, you won't be able to enable Advanced protection. Alternatively, you can enable Advanced protection directly from the app, in the Protection tab (second from the left in the bottom icon row). AdGuard's Safari Web extension only works on iOS versions 15 and later. "

57,"AdGuard has many ad-blocking products for various platforms, and each product has its own unique features. But what unites them all is that they block ads and trackers. This article describes how ad blocking works from the inside. We don't cover DNS filtering here. It's a different way of blocking ads, with its own advantages and disadvantages. Follow this link to learn more about DNS filtering. General principle Filter lists, also called filters, lie at the core of any ad blocker. Filters are literally lists of rules written in a special syntax. Ad blockers can understand this complex syntax. They interpret filtering rules and perform actions on web traffic based on what the rules tell them to do: block specific elements, alter web pages in certain ways, etc. Filter lists To better understand ad blocking, it's important to know the underlying principles of how filters work. Filtering rules that make up filters are not created automatically. They are developed by filter maintainers, including professionals and volunteers, who use browser developer consoles and other tools (such as the AdGuard's filtering log) to determine which rules will block a particular ad or tracker. This description of the process is very simplistic – some ads are particularly hard to block and require multiple rules, multiple iterations, and the use of complex syntax. And even when a rule finally gets added to a filter, it doesn't mean that it stays there forever. Ads change, ways to serve the same ads on the same websites change, and the filter rules have to change, too. Sometimes rules become obsolete, a new ad appears, or a new filtering rule is needed to block the same ad. Filters are often maintained by one person, but even for a team of maintainers, it's impossible to constantly monitor the entire web. That's why many ad blockers have tools to help users easily report any filter-related issues they encounter. AdGuard users have access to a special web reporting tool. Thanks to user complaints, filter developers can focus on correcting their filter lists and not on scouring the Internet for new and old unblocked ads. Filters can do more than just block ads. There are filters that block tracking, social media widgets, and annoyances such as cookie notices. Different users may choose different combinations of filters to match their personal preferences. There are websites like filterlists.com that are dedicated to filter lists and have huge databases. We develop and maintain our own set of filter lists that can be used with AdGuard or other ad blockers. Types of filtering rules There are many types of filtering rules that serve different purposes. Depending on the ad blocker you use, and especially on your OS, some types of rules may not be supported. Basic filtering rules To be displayed on a web page or in an app, the ad has to be loaded from a server first. To do so, the browser or the app needs to send a web request. The most basic way of preventing an ad from appearing on your screen is to block this request so it never reaches the server, and thus there's no reply. Basically, all AdGuard Ad Blocker products can block web requests according to the active filter rules. This method is very effective at stopping the ad, but it has some drawbacks. The most obvious one is: whatever place an ad was taking up will be left empty or occupied by an ad leftover. Cosmetic filtering rules Every web page has a Document Object Model (DOM), an HTML document containing the structure and elements of this page. As ads are also page elements, they get recorded in the DOM. Ad blockers can remove parts of the DOM, while filtering rules help them understand which parts are ads and should be removed, and which parts should be left intact. This method allows you to avoid above-mentioned blank spaces and ad leftovers, as well as perform other more complicated tasks. HTML filtering rules In most cases, it's enough to use the above-mentioned basic and cosmetic rules to filter ads. But when it is necessary to change the HTML code of the page itself before it is loaded, you need filtering rules for HTML content. These rules allow you to specify the HTML elements to be cut out before the browser even loads the page. These rules are quite complicated and require the ad blocker to be granted certain access rights, so not all platforms support them. Currently, these rules work only in the AdGuard Firefox add-on and in the AdGuard apps for Windows, Mac, and Android. There are other types of filtering rules, but they require more advanced technical knowledge to understand how they work. If you are interested, check out our comprehensive guide on filtering rules in the linked article. "
58," Disclaimer: AdGuard for Android is not to be confused with AdGuard Content Blocker. AdGuard Content Blocker is an app available in Google Play that has truncated functionality to meet restrictions imposed by the store. AdGuard for Android, on the contrary, is a powerful application to block ads, manage applications, and perform other roles that will be described in this article. The only place it can be downloaded from is the AdGuard website. Ad blocking Any ad blocker's main purpose is to block ads, and for the majority of AdGuard software ad-blocking algorithms are mostly the same. The mechanism of filtering ads is described here. The ad-blocking feature is pretty obvious in its concept, but there are some points worthy of a separate mention. Most importantly, AdGuard works as a universal filter sifting through your apps traffic and deciding what to do with this or that web request. The whole process is managed by filters — lists of special rules. The program has a default and constantly updated set of filters but you can also add your own filtering rules and filters to this set. Most mobile ad blockers for Android use this principle, but what is pretty much the whole app in their case is only one of the many features for AdGuard. Read this comparative article to learn the differences between AdGuard and other ad blockers. Filters The program uses a lot of different filters, our own and third-party ones, sorted by language and their purpose. For example, filters in the Annoyances category are very different from the language-specific ones. Find out more about all the filters available for AdGuard products by reading their descriptions in the app or this comprehensive article. Custom filters AdGuard allows you to create your own custom filters, using the same type of rules that we have in our filters. If you want to try your hand at this, we would recommend studying the article on creating your own ad filters which describes the AdGuard rules syntax in detail and provides plenty of examples. Tip: use the Import feature to transfer your rules to a different device. HTTPS filtering {#https-filtering} Nowadays almost all websites work via HTTPS, the web protocol where the last S letter stands for ""secure"". It happened so that most advertisers use this protocol as well, this is why HTTPS filtering is really crucial for a modern ad blocker. To be able to filter HTTPS traffic, AdGuard needs to install a certificate into your device's user storage. On older versions of Android OS this was done automatically during the onboarding process or later via AdGuard settings, and it only required a couple of taps. On Android 11 and later automatic certificate installation is no longer available. Now you need to install the certificate manually. Here is the installation instruction: Go to the app's main screen and tap Turn on next to the HTTPS filtering is off message (it will be highlighted in orange if the AdGuard certificate is not installed yet). A new screen will appear, tap Next, Next and Save it now when prompted to download the AdGuard certificate. After the certificate is downloaded, you will see a new screen. Tap Open security settings. This will bring up system settings. Scroll down to Advanced, open it and then tap Encryption & credentials (these settings may be called variously on different devices — the main thing is to choose advanced security settings). Tap Install certificate and then CA certificate. A warning message will appear. Read through it and tap Install anyway to proceed. Select the recently downloaded AdGuard certificate. A CA certificate installed toast message should show up. The AdGuard certificate is successfully installed and HTTPS filtering is working now! If you update from Android 10 to Android 11, there's a chance that the already installed certificate will still be accepted. Otherwise, the HTTPS filtering is off warning will appear on the main screen, highlighted in orange. So you'll need to go through the same process of reinstalling the certificate manually. In case you have problems with the certificate installation, read this article or contact our support team at support@adguard.com. We want to emphasize that AdGuard Ad Blocker will function without HTTPS filtering. However, it won't be able to properly filter ads on sites that use the HTTPS protocol (most of sites do that). So if you want to use the full functionality of the app and get the best ad filtering quality and processing speed, we strongly recommend you to activate HTTPS-filtering. Stealth Mode Many websites gather information about their visitors, such as their IP addresses, information about the browser and operating system installed, screen resolution, and even what page the user came or was redirected from. Some web pages use cookies to mark the browser and save your personal settings, user preferences, or ""recognize"" you upon your next visit. Stealth Mode safeguards your personal information from such data and statistics gathering systems. You can flexibly adjust the work of Stealth Mode: for instance, you can prohibit the website to receive the search request you used to find it on the Internet, automatically delete both third-party and website’s own cookies, and disable location sharing in your browser that can be used to track your whereabouts. To learn all the main features and options you can manage in the Stealth mode settings, read this article. Browsing Security Phishing is a fraudulent online practice aimed at obtaining sensitive information like usernames, passwords, credit card details and such from internet users. This form of fraud, effected through spoof emailing and fake websites posing as trusted mediums like banks, social services etc., is causing more financial damage every year. As for malware (malicious software), it is as the name suggests — any type of software designed with the intent to damage the personal computer or other device it gets into. What once began as a prank now is a tool to steal confidential information from users and businesses. Fortunately, AdGuard's Browsing Security module protects you from visiting phishing and malicious websites. It also warns you about malware being downloaded onto your device. In case you want to learn more about Browsing Security, read this article. But note that AdGuard for Android is not an antivirus. It will neither stop the actual download of a virus nor delete the already existing ones. For the complete protection of your device, we recommend using AdGuard in tandem with a dedicated AV tool. At the same time, we'd like to emphasize that your personal data is not transferred anywhere, and AdGuard does not know which websites you are visiting. The security check is not performed against an open web address (URL) but through hash prefixes (hash is a certain data structure that renders unambiguous each address added to the base). However, you can send us information on the websites you visit to improve the database, if you opt to. Learn more about AdGuard's phishing and malware protection. Control your apps One of the main stated purposes of AdGuard for Android is to give users back the full control over their devices. With AdGuard, you can see comprehensive information about all web requests coming through your device. No app will be able to go online without you knowing. Apps management In the Apps Management module you can choose which apps should have Wi-Fi or mobile data access, which will be filtered by AdGuard and which not. You can also change the background Internet access rules for your apps when the screen is locked. These settings can be applied to all installed apps at once or on the individual basis. You can find extra settings in the upper right corner of the Apps Management screen. They will help you fine-tune AdGuard for Android to your preference. For example, you can make the common settings applicable to each and every app, or select the apps which need a more detailed approach. By tapping the icons, you will see a screen showing app-specific traffic to help you make more informed decisions. AdGuard is of help not only with ad filtering and privacy protection, it can aid your device function better, saving battery life and traffic as well. Filtering log In the Filtering Log, you can directly observe all web requests made by browsers and apps. Thanks to this feature, you have full control over all processes on your device. You can block each request right there in one tap (or unblock it, if the request is already blocked). There's also detailed information about each request, although it is mostly aimed at the advanced users, particularly those who create their own filtering rules. We will be elaborating on it just a bit further below. User rules As mentioned above, AdGuard for Android uses a set of filters to block ads. And then there is the User rules section that allows you to create and adjust your own filtering rules. It is located in the Settings tab of the AdGuard menu. When you first install AdGuard, the User rules section is empty. To fill it with rules, you will need to understand the basics of the rules syntax. Don't worry if you are not familiar with it, here's a good place to start should you feel an urge to delve deeper into custom rules creation. By the way, whenever you use Filtering Log to block anything, a corresponding rule will appear in User rules, so use it if you ever want to undo the blocking. And generally speaking, Filtering Log and User rules go together particularly well: you can use the former to monitor requests in order to build a correct rule for the User rules. DNS filtering The DNS Filtering module allows to configure DNS settings on the user's device, including the chosen DNS server, DNS protocol, and DNS filters that block ads and trackers. A bit of a theory refresher: DNS stands for ""Domain name system"", and its purpose is to translate domain names into something browsers can understand, i.e. IP addresses. So, each time you go to a website, your browser sends a DNS request to a server, usually determined by your ISP. That server either redirects the request to another (upstream) server or replies with an IP address. If you use a special DNS server instead of a default one, it can send unsafe and potentially dangerous requests to the ""void"". Thus, the responses with the IP addresses won't be received and ""bad requests"" will be nipped in the bud. DNS filtering has its own separate tab within the AdGuard for Android app home screen. Here you can choose which type of DNS you wish to use (it can be either regular DNS or high-security DNS — we will get to that later on) as well as enable DNS-level blocking. DNS blocking DNS blocking is a standalone feature that complements AdGuard protection suite. There are two methods of DNS blocking: Some DNS servers can block DNS requests to potentially harmful domains. There is built-in DNS filtering that works right on your device and can block DNS requests, in addition to what's blocked by the selected DNS server. How exactly does DNS filtering work? It has a special DNS filter which contains a large list of ad and tracker domains, which it uses in conjunction with User rules to recognize 'bad' requests. Every request is checked against this filter, and if there's a hit, instead of forwarding it to the DNS server, it is being rerouted to a 'blackhole'. The simplicity of this approach is both a benefit and a disadvantage. The main advantage of this approach is that it's both battery life friendly and traffic-saving. Once a domain is blocked, it won't be requested again within an hour. The disadvantage would be the ""roughness"" of this method: specific URLs can't be blocked, only whole domains. Sometimes the only way to block ads by DNS is to add a rule that will break something at the same time. In this case, we just don't add this rule and the ad remains unblocked — because the alternative where the website does not work at all is even worse. DNS servers But AdGuard for Android ""DNS package"" does not end just there. One of the useful perks is an option to select absolutely any DNS server to use. At your service is a list consisting of dozens of servers to choose from, from our own AdGuard DNS servers to other popular providers like Google DNS, Cloudflare and others. On top of that, if your favorite server is not in the default list, you still can enter its address manually and use it anyway. See the comprehensive list of popular DNS providers — you can find many DNS servers there and any to AdGuard with a tap of a finger. There are several reasons to use a custom DNS server instead of one offered by your ISP by default. Some servers are faster, some provide ad blocking or parental control solutions, some enhance your privacy etc. But DNS servers not only vary by function. Besides, they can also differ by supported protocol types. There are three main types of protocols that DNS servers work over: HTTPS, TLS, and QUIC. Correspondingly, there are DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ). While the first two are standard protocols, the third (DoQ) is experimental, yet the most outstanding one. We'll describe it later. Choosing a DNS server from a trusted provider is essential to protect DNS traffic. When user's DNS traffic is safe, their privacy and security are increased, and it's easier to prevent eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS data via man-in-the-middle attacks (MITMs). DNS-over-QUIC DNS-over-QUIC (DoQ) is a rather new encryption protocol and AdGuard DNS is the first public resolver that supports it. Unlike DoH and DoT, it uses QUIC as a transport protocol and finally brings DNS back to its roots — working over UDP. It brings all the good things that QUIC has to offer — out-of-the-box encryption, reduced connection times, better performance when data packets are lost. Also, QUIC is supposed to be a transport-level protocol and there are no risks of metadata leaks that could happen with DoH. To learn more about DNS-over-QUIC, check out this article dedicated entirely to it. To enable DoQ in AdGuard for Android, perform the following steps: Open the app, then open the side menu Go to Settings → DNS Filtering and enable it Select any of AdGuard DNS servers from the list of available servers Under Server type choose DNS-over-QUIC DNS user filter It is very much like the regular User filter, but for DNS requests. You'll find DNS user filter at Settings → DNS Filtering → DNS Requests blocking. DNS User filter supports two types of syntax: a limited portion of AdGuard syntax and ""hosts"" syntax. You can read more about it in our Knowledge Base. Custom DNS filters You can add any custom DNS filters or custom hosts lists. A useful feature considering how popular hosts lists are among Internet users. This option is available on the Settings → DNS Filtering → DNS Requests blocking screen. Proxy and TOR A proxy server is basically another computer serving as a hub that processes your internet requests. You can set up AdGuard to route all your device's traffic through any proxy — and you'll be able to configure the whole thing right inside the app. And here is an instruction on how to set up a proxy. Some popular VPN providers offer an alternative way to use their service as a proxy. This can be used to run them alongside AdGuard in local VPN mode. Contrary to a popular opinion, using a proxy server is not just about bypassing access restriction to geoblocked resources. It is about security! If you are using a proxy server, intruders won't know what websites you visit. You can also use AdGuard along with the anonymity network TOR (we have already integrated AdGuard with Tor for your convenience!). Here is a Wiki article where the whole concept of TOR network is nicely explained in case you wish to find out more. Extensions support Userscripts (we also call them extensions) are basically mini-programs written in JavaScript that extend the functionality of one or more websites. Usually, you'd need some special userscript manager to add them, and it's traditionally more of a desktop thing. But with AdGuard everything is possible! Now you can add any userscripts by URL or load them from a file, and AdGuard will serve as a userscript manager and take care of the rest. Go to Settings → Extensions to enable some of the pre-installed extensions or to add custom userscripts. By the way, you can tap any added userscript to see more details, and to reinstall or delete it. Compatibility with AdGuard VPN The best kind of compatibility is when you install two apps and they just start working together. Presuming you already have AdGuard Ad Blocker installed, just download AdGuard VPN from Play Store (you can get there right from the ad blocker app, there's an item in General settings). Both apps will detect each other and do everything that's needed for smooth joint work. All that will be left for you is to enjoy both ad-free Internet and the benefits of a VPN. It also works the other way around just as well: install AdGuard Ad Blocker on top of an already-running AdGuard VPN and you're good. If you'd like to disable Compatibility Mode for any reason, it's very simple to do so from AdGuard Ad Blocker settings, just toggle the switch. Additionally, you can add AdGuard Ad Blocker and AdGuard VPN tiles to your device's notification bar and toggle them in one tap at your own will — thanks to Compatibility Mode the configuration will change immediately and silently. License While some ot the features in AdGuard for Android are free, others require purchasing a license. There are Personal (up to three devices) and Family (up to 9 devices), Yearly and Lifetime license keys. The premium version offers the following features to its users: Stealth Mode Browsing security Extensions Ad blocking in all apps (not only browsers) Custom filters Read this article to learn how to activate the license key. Other features There are too many features to describe them all in detail, so let us simply list them here: When you visit certain screens for the first time, there will appear tooltips that describe the purpose of that screen and its main features You can export or import AdGuard settings (for a faster switch between the settings profiles or to transfer your profile between different devices) Select an update channel, i.e. the mode in which the application receives its updates (stable release channel, less stable beta channel and raw ""nightly"" channel By tapping a little battery icon on the main screen of the app you will get to the ""Battery Usage"" screen. System battery stats are often wrong, so we decided to have our own, one that would reflect the real state of things You can change the app's language in the General Settings tab "

60,"A filter is a set of filtering rules applied to specific content, such as banners or pop-ups. AdGuard has a list of standard filters created by our team. We constantly improve and update them, striving to meet the needs of most of our users. At the same time, AdGuard allows you to create your own custom filters using the same types of rules that we have in our filters. To describe the syntax of our filtering rules, we use Augmented BNF for Syntax Specifications, but we do not always strictly follow this specification. Originally, the AdGuard's syntax was based on the syntax of Adblock Plus rules. Later, we extended it with new types of rules for better ad filtering. Some parts of this article about the rules common both to AdGuard and ABP were taken from this article. Comments Any line that starts with an exclamation mark is a comment. In the list of rules it is displayed in gray color. AdGuard will ignore this line, so you can write anything you want. Comments are usually placed above the rules and used to describe what a rule does. For example: ! This is the comment. Under this line there is an actual filtering rule. ||example.org^ Examples Blocking by domain name This rule blocks: http://example.org/ad1.gif http://subdomain.example.org/ad1.gif https://ads.example.org:8000/ This rule does not block: http://ads.example.org.us/ad1.gif http://example.com/redirect/http://ads.example.org/ Blocking exact address This rule blocks: http://example.org/ This rule does not block: https://example.org/banner/img Basic rule modifiers Filtering rules support numerous modifiers that allow you to fine-tune the rule behavior. Here is an example of a rule with some simple modifiers. This rule blocks: http://example.org/script.js if this script is loaded from example.com. This rule does not block: https://example.org/script.js if this script is loaded from example.org. https://example.org/banner.png because it is not a script. Unblocking an address This rule unblocks: http://example.org/banner.png even if there is a blocking rule for this address. Blocking rules with $important modifier can override exceptions. Unblocking everything on a website This rule unblocks It disables all cosmetic rules on example.com. It unblocks all requests sent from this website even if there is are blocking rules matching these requests. Cosmetic rule Cosmetic rules are based on using a special language named CSS, which every browser understands. Basically, it adds a new CSS style to the website which purpose is to hide particular elements. You can learn more about CSS in general here. AdGuard extends CSS and lets filters developers handle much more complicated cases. However, to use these extended rules, you need to be fluent in regular CSS. Popular CSS selectors Name CSS selector Description ID selector #banners Matches all elements with id attribute equal to banners. Class selector .banners Matches all elements with class attribute containing banners. Attribute selector div[class=""banners""] Matches all div elements with class attribute exactly equal to banners. Attribute substring selector div[class^=""advert1""] Matches all div elements which class attribute starts with the advert1 string. Attribute substring selector div[class$=""banners_ads""] Matches all div elements which class attribute ends with the banners_ads string. Attribute substring selector a[href^=""http://example.com/""] Matches all links that are loaded from http://example.com/ domain. Attribute selector a[href=""http://example.com/""] Matches all links to exactly the http://example.com/ address. Restrictions Trusted filters {#trusted-filters} Some rules can be used only in trusted filters. This category includes: filter lists created by the AdGuard team, custom filter lists installed as trusted, user rules. Basic rules The most simple rules are so-called Basic rules. They are used to block requests to specific URLs. Or to unblock it, if there is a special marker ""@@"" at the beginning of the rule. The basic principle for this type of rules is quite simple: you have to specify the address and additional parameters that limit or expand the rule scope. Sub-requests Basic rules for blocking requests are applied only to sub-requests. That means they will not block the loading of the page. Response status Browser detects a blocked request as completed with an error. Basic rules syntax {#basic-rules-syntax} rule = [""@@""] pattern [ ""$"" modifiers ] modifiers = [modifier0, modifier1[, ...[, modifierN]]] pattern — an address mask. Every request URL is collated to this mask. You can also use special characters in the template, their description is below. Note that AdGuard trims URLs to a length of 4096 characters in order to speed up matching and avoid issues with ridiculously long URLs. @@ — a marker that is used in rules of exception. To turn off filtering for a request, start your rule with this marker. modifiers — parameters that ""clarify"" the basic rule. Some of them limit the rule scope and some can completely change they way it works. Special characters {#basic-rules-special-characters} * — a wildcard character. It is used to represent ""any set of characters"". This can also be an empty string or a string of any length. || — matching the beginning of an address. With this character you do not have to specify a particular protocol and subdomain in address mask. It means, || stands for http://*., https://*., ws://*., wss://*. at once. ^ — a separator character mark. Separator character is any character, but a letter, a digit, or one of the following: _ - . %. In this example separator characters are shown in bold: http://example.com/?t=1&t2=t3. The end of the address is also accepted as separator. | — a pointer to the beginning or the end of address. The value depends on the character placement in the mask. For example, a rule swf| corresponds to http://example.com/annoyingflash.swf , but not to http://example.com/swf/index.html. |http://example.org corresponds to http://example.org, but not to http://domain.com?url=http://example.org. Visual representation We also recommend to get acquainted with this article, for better understanding of how such rules should be made. Regular expressions support {#regexp-support} If you want even more flexibility in making rules, you can use Regular expressions instead of a default simplified mask with special characters. Performance Rules with regular expressions work more slowly, therefore it is recommended to avoid them or to limit their scope to specific domains. If you want a blocker to determine a regular expression, the pattern has to look like this: pattern = ""/"" regexp ""/"" For example, /banner\d+/$third-party this rule will apply the regular expression banner\d+ to all third-party requests. Exclusion rule with regular expression looks like this: @@/banner\d+/. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard AdGuard Safari and AdGuard for iOS do not fully support regular expressions because of Content Blocking API restrictions (look for ""The Regular expression format"" section). Wildcard support for TLD (top-level domains) {#wildcard-for-tld} Wildcard characters are supported for TLDs of the domains in patterns of cosmetic, HTML filtering and JavaScript rules. For cosmetic rules, e.g. example.*##.banner, multiple domains are matched due to the part .*, i.e. example.com, sub.example.net, example.co.uk, etc. For basic rules the described logic is applicable only for the domains specified in $domain modifier, e.g. ||*/banners/*$image,domain=example.*. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard In AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android, and AdGuard Browser extension rules with wildcard .* match any public suffix (or eTLD). But for AdGuard for Safari and iOS the supported list of top-level domains is limited due to Safari limitations. Rules with wildcard for TLD are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. Basic rules examples ||example.com/ads/* — a simple rule, which corresponds to addresses like http://example.com/ads/banner.jpg and even http://subdomain.example.com/ads/otherbanner.jpg. ||example.org^$third-party — this rule blocks third-party requests to example.org and its subdomains. @@||example.com$document — general exception rule. It completely disables filtering for example.com and all subdomains. There is a number of modifiers which can be used in exception rules. For more details, please follow the link below. Basic rules modifiers Basic modifiers Content type modifiers Exception modifiers Note The features described in this section are intended for experienced users. They extend capabilities of ""Basic rules"", but in order to use them you need to have a basic understanding of the way your browser works. You can change the behavior of a ""basic rule"" by using additional modifiers. Modifiers should be located in the end of the rule after a $ sign and be separated by commas. Example: ||domain.com^$popup,third-party Basic modifiers {#basic-rules-basic-modifiers} $domain $to $third-party $popup $match-case $header The following modifiers are the most simple and frequently used. $domain {#domain-modifier} $domain limits the rule scope to requests made from the specified domains and their subdomains (as indicated by the Referer HTTP header). To add multiple domains to one rule, use the | character as a separator. Examples Just $domain: ||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org blocks requests that match the specified mask, and are sent from domain example.org or its subdomains. ||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org|example.com — the same rule, but it works for both example.org and example.com. If you want the rule not to be applied to certain domains, start a domain name with ~ sign. $domain and negation ~: ||baddomain.com^$domain=~example.org blocks requests matching the pattern sent from any domain except example.org and its subdomains. ||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org|~foo.example.org blocks requests sent from example.org and its subdomains, except the subdomain foo.example.org. $domain modifier matching target domain: In some cases the $domain modifier can match not only the referrer domain, but also the target domain. This happens when all of the following is true: The request has document content type. The rule pattern does not match any particular domains. The rule pattern does not contain regular expressions. The $domain modifier contains only excluded domains, e.g. $domain=~example.org|~example.com. The following predicate should be satisfied to perform a target domain matching: 1 AND ((2 AND 3) OR 4) That is, if the modifier $domain contains only excluded domains, then the rule does not need to meet the second and third conditions to match the target domain against the modifier $domain. If some of the conditions above are not met but the rule contains $cookie or $csp modifier, the target domain will still be matched. If the referrer matches a rule with $domain that explicitly excludes the referrer domain, then the rule will not be applied even if the target domain also matches the rule. This affects rules with $cookie and $csp modifiers, too. Examples *$cookie,domain=example.org|example.com will block cookies for all requests to and from example.org and example.com. *$document,domain=example.org|example.com will block all requests to and from example.org and example.com. In the following examples it is implied that requests are sent from http://example.org/page (the referrer) and the target URL is http://targetdomain.com/page. page$domain=example.org will be matched, as it matches the referrer domain. page$domain=targetdomain.com will be matched, as it matches the target domain and satisfies all requirements mentioned above. ||*page$domain=targetdomain.com will not be matched, as the pattern ||*page matches specific domains. ||*page$domain=targetdomain.com,cookie will be matched despite the pattern ||*page matches specific domains because it contains $cookie modifier. /banner\d+/$domain=targetdomain.com will not be matched as it contains a regular expression. page$domain=targetdomain.com|~example.org will not be matched because the referrer domain is explicitly excluded. Limitations Safari does not support the simultaneous use of allowed and disallowed domains, so rules like ||baddomain.com^$domain=example.org|~foo.example.org will not work in AdGuard for Safari. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Starting with CoreLibs v1.12, the $domain modifier can be alternatively spelled as $from. $to {#to-modifier} $to limits the rule scope to requests made to the specified domains and their subdomains. To add multiple domains to one rule, use the | character as a separator. Examples /ads$to=evil.com|evil.org blocks any request to evil.com or evil.org and their subdomains with a path matching /ads. /ads$to=~not.evil.com|evil.com blocks any request to evil.com and its subdomains, with a path matching /ads, except requests to not.evil.com and its subdomains. /ads$to=~good.com|~good.org blocks any request with a path matching /ads, except requests to good.com or good.org and their subdomains. Compatibility with other modifiers $denyallow can not be used together with $to. It can be expressed with inverted $to: $denyallow=a.com|b.com is equivalent to $to=~a.com|~b.com. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard $to is available starting with CoreLibs v1.12. $third-party {#third-party-modifier} A restriction of third-party and own requests. A third-party request is a request from a different domain. For example, a request to example.org, from domain.com is a third-party request. Note To be considered as such, a third-party request should meet one of the following conditions: Its referrer is not a subdomain of the target domain or vice versa. For example, a request to subdomain.example.org from example.org is not a third-party request. Its Sec-Fetch-Site header is set to cross-site. If there is a $third-party modifier, the rule is only applied to third-party requests. Examples $third-party: ||domain.com^$third-party — this rule applies to all domains, except domain.com and its subdomains. A third-party request example: http://example.org/banner.jpg. If there is a $~third-party modifier, the rule is only applied to the requests that are not from third-party. Which means, they have to be sent from the same domain. $~third-party: ||domain.com$~third-party — this rule is applied to domain.com, but not to the other domains. Example of a request that is not a third-party request: http://domain.com/icon.ico. $popup {#popup-modifier} AdGuard will try to close the browser tab with any address that matches a blocking rule with this modifier. Please note that not all the tabs can be closed. Note It may not work if the popped up page is cached by the browser. Examples ||domain.com^$popup — if you try to go to http://domain.com/ from any page in the browser, a new tab in which specified site has to be opened will be closed by this rule. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard $popup modifier works best in AdGuard Browser Extension. In AdGuard for Safari and iOS, $popup rules simply block the page right away. In AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, $popup modifier may not detect a popup in some cases and it won't be blocked. $popup modifier applies the document content type with a special flag which is passed to a blocking page. Blocking page itself can do some checks and close the window if it is really a popup. Otherwise, page should be loaded. It can be combined with other request type modifiers, such as $third-party and $important. However, the blocking page may not detect a popup in some cases, so it is recommended to use the AdGuard Popup Blocker userscript instead. $match-case {#match-case-modifier} This modifier defines a rule which applies only to addresses that match the case. Default rules are case-insensitive. Examples */BannerAd.gif$match-case — this rule will block http://example.com/BannerAd.gif, but not http://example.com/bannerad.gif. $header {#header-modifier} The $header modifier allows matching the HTTP response having a specific header with (optionally) a specific value. Syntax $header ""="" h_name ["":"" h_value] h_value = string / regexp where: h_name — required, an HTTP header name. It is matched case-insesitively. h_value — optional, an HTTP header value matching expression, it may be one of the following: string — a sequence of characters. It is matched against the header value lexicographically; regexp — a regular expression, starts and ends with /. The pattern works the same way as in the basic URL rules, but the characters /, $ and , must be escaped with \. The modifier "":"" h_value part may be omitted. In that case the modifier matches the header name only. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with the $header modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.11 or later. Examples ||example.com^$header=set-cookie:foo blocks requests which responses have the Set-Cookie header with the value matching foo literally. ||example.com^$header=set-cookie blocks requests which responses have the Set-Cookie header with any value. @@||example.com^$header=set-cookie:/foo\, bar\$/ unblocks requests which responses have the Set-Cookie header with value matching the foo, bar$ regular expression. @@||example.com^$header=set-cookie unblocks requests which responses have a Set-Cookie header with any value. Restriction by content type {#content-type-modifiers} $document $image $stylesheet $script $object $font $media $subdocument $ping $xmlhttprequest $websocket $other $object-subrequest (deprecated) $webrtc (deprecated) There is a set of modifiers, which can be used to limit the rule's application area to certain type of content. These modifiers can also be combined to cover, for example, both images and scripts. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard There is a big difference in how AdGuard determines the content type on different platforms. For AdGuard Browser extension, content type for every request is provided by browser. AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android use following method: first we try to determine the type of the request by the Sec-Fetch-Dest request header or by the filename extension. If the request is not blocked at this stage, the type will be determined using the Content-Type header at the beginning of the server response. Content type modifiers examples ||example.org^$image — corresponds to all images from example.org. ||example.org^$script,stylesheet — corresponds to all the scripts and styles from example.org. ||example.org^$~image,~script,~stylesheet — corresponds to all requests to example.org except for the images, scripts and styles. $document {#document-modifier} The rule corresponds to the main frame document requests, i.e. HTML documents that are loaded in the browser tab. It does not match iframes, there is a $subdocument modifier for these. By default, AdGuard does not block the requests that are loaded in the browser tab (e.g. ""main frame bypass""). The idea is not to prevent pages from loading as the user clearly indicated that they want this page to be loaded. However, if the $document modifier is specified explicitly, AdGuard does not use that logic and prevents the page load. Instead, it responds with a ""blocking page"". If this modifier is used with an exclusion rule (@@), it completely disables blocking on corresponding pages. It is equivalent to using $elemhide, $content, $urlblock, $jsinject, and $extension modifiers simultaneously. Examples @@||example.com^$document completely disables filtering on all pages at example.com and all subdomains. @@||example.com^$document,~extension completely disables blocking on any pages at example.com and all subdomains, but continues to run userscripts there. ||example.com^$document blocks HTML document request to example.com with a blocking page. ||example.com^$document,redirect=noopframe redirects HTML document request to example.com to an empty html document. ||example.com^$document,removeparam=test removes test query parameter from HTML document request to example.com. ||example.com^$document,replace=/test1/test2/ replaces test1 with test2 in HTML document request to example.com. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Blocking rules with $document modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. $image {#image-modifier} The rule corresponds to images requests. $stylesheet {#stylesheet-modifier} The rule corresponds to CSS files requests. $script {#script-modifier} The rule corresponds to script requests, e.g. javascript, vbscript. $object {#object-modifier} The rule corresponds to browser plugins resources, e.g. Java or Flash. $font {#font-modifier} The rule corresponds to requests for fonts, e.g. .woff filename extension. $media {#media-modifier} The rule corresponds to requests for media files — music and video, e.g. .mp4 files. $subdocument {#subdocument-modifier} The rule corresponds to requests for built-in pages — HTML tags frame and iframe. Examples ||example.com^$subdocument blocks built-in page requests (frame and iframe) to example.com and all its subdomains anywhere. ||example.com^$subdocument,domain=domain.com blocks built-in page requests (frame и iframe) to example.com (and its subdomains) from domain.com and all its subdomains. $ping {#ping-modifier} The rule corresponds to requests caused by either navigator.sendBeacon() or the ping attribute on links. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android often cannot accurately detect navigator.sendBeacon(). For reliable detection, use AdGuard Browser extension. $xmlhttprequest {#xmlhttprequest-modifier} The rule applies only to ajax requests (requests sent via javascript object XMLHttpRequest). Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android often cannot accurately detect this type and sometimes detects it as $other or $script. For reliable detection, use AdGuard Browser extension. $websocket {#websocket-modifier} The rule applies only to WebSocket connections. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard $websocket modifier is supported in all AdGuard products except AdGuard Content Blocker. As for AdGuard for Safari and AdGuard for iOS, it's supported on devices with macOS Monterey (version 12) and iOS 16 or higher. $other {#other-modifier} The rule applies to requests for which the type has not been determined or does not match the types listed above. $webrtc (deprecated) {#webrtc-modifier} Deprecation notice This modifier is deprecated and is no longer supported. Rules with it are considered as invalid. If you need to suppress WebRTC, consider using the nowebrtc scriptlet. The rule applies only to WebRTC connections. Examples ||example.com^$webrtc,domain=example.org blocks webRTC connections to example.com for example.org. @@*$webrtc,domain=example.org disables the RTC wrapper for example.org. $object-subrequest (deprecated) {#object-subrequest-modifier} Deprecation notice $object-subrequest modifier is deprecated and is no longer supported. Rules with it are considered as invalid. The rule corresponds to requests by browser plugins (it is usually Flash). Exception modifiers {#exception-modifiers} $elemhide $content $jsinject $urlblock $extension $stealth $specifichide Generic rules $generichide $genericblock Exception rules disable the other basic rules for the addresses to which they correspond. They begin with a @@ mark. All the basic modifiers listed above can be applied to them and they also have a few special modifiers. Visual representation We recommend to get acquainted with this article, for better understanding of how exception rules should be made. $elemhide {#elemhide-modifier} Disables any cosmetic rules on the pages matching the rule. Examples @@||example.com^$elemhide disables all cosmetic rules on pages at example.com and all subdomains. $content {#content-modifier} Disables HTML filtering and $replace rules on the pages that match the rule. Examples @@||example.com^$content disables all HTML filtering rules and replace rules on pages at example.com and all its subdomains. $jsinject {#jsinject-modifier} Forbids adding of javascript code to the page. You can read about javascript rules further. Examples @@||example.com^$jsinject disables javascript on pages at example.com and all subdomains. $urlblock {#urlblock-modifier} Disables blocking of all requests sent from the pages matching the rule. Examples @@||example.com^$urlblock — any requests sent from the pages at example.com and all subdomains are not going to be blocked. $extension {#extension-modifier} Disables all userscripts on the pages matching this rule. Examples @@||example.com^$extension — userscripts will not work on all pages of the example.com website. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Only AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android are technically capable of using rules with $extension modifier. $stealth {#stealth-modifier} Disables the Stealth Mode module for all corresponding pages and requests. Syntax $stealth [= opt1 [| opt2 [| opt3 [...]]]] opt(i) stand for certain Stealth Mode options disabled by the modifier. The modifier can contain any number of options (see below) or not contain them at all. In the latter case the modifier disables all the Stealth Mode features. The list of the available modifier options: searchqueries disables Hide your search queries option donottrack disables Send Do-Not-Track header option 3p-cookie disables Self-destructing third-party cookies option 1p-cookie disables Self-destructing first-party cookies option 3p-cache disables Disable cache for third-party requests option 3p-auth disables Block third-party Authorization header option webrtc disables Block WebRTC option push disables Block Push API option location disables Block Location API option flash disables Block Flash option java disables Block Java option referrer disables Hide Referrer from third parties option useragent disables Hide your User-Agent option ip disables Hide your IP address option xclientdata disables Remove X-Client-Data header from HTTP requests option dpi disables Protect from DPI option Examples @@||example.com^$stealth disables Stealth Mode for example.com (and subdomains) requests, except for blocking cookies and hiding tracking parameters (see below). @@||domain.com^$script,stealth,domain=example.com disables Stealth Mode only for script requests to domain.com (and its subdomains) on example.com and all its subdomains. @@||example.com^$stealth=3p-cookie|dpi disables blocking third-party cookies and DPI fooling measures for example.com. Note Blocking cookies and removing tracking parameters is achieved by using rules with $cookie and $removeparam modifiers. Exception rules with only $stealth modifier will not do those things. If you want to completely disable all Stealth Mode features for a given domain, you need to include all three modifiers: @@||example.org^$stealth,removeparam,cookie Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Stealth Mode is available in AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android, and AdGuard Browser extension. All other products will ignore the rules with $stealth modifier. $stealth modifier with specific options is supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.10 or later. specifichide {#specifichide-modifier} Disables all specific element hiding and CSS rules, but not general ones. Has an opposite effect to $generichide. Examples @@||example.org^$specifichide disables example.org##.banner but not ##.banner. Note All cosmetic rules — not just specific ones — can be disabled by $elemhide modifier. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with $specifichide modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android, and AdGuard Browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Edge. Generic rules {#exception-modifiers-generic-rules} Before we can proceed to the next modifiers, we have to make a definition of generic rules. The rule is generic if it is not limited to specific domains. Wildcard character * is supported as well. For example, these rules are generic: ###banner *###banner #@#.adsblock *#@#.adsblock ~domain.com###banner ||domain.com^ ||domain.com^$domain=~example.com And these are not: domain.com###banner ||domain.com^$domain=example.com $generichide {#generichide-modifier} Disables all generic cosmetic rules on pages that correspond to exception rule. Examples @@||example.com^generichide — disables generic cosmetic rules on any pages at example.com and all subdomains. $genericblock {#genericblock-modifier} Disables generic basic rules on pages that correspond to exception rule. Examples @@||example.com^$genericblock — disables generic basic rules on any pages at example.com and all subdomains. Advanced capabilities $important $badfilter $replace $csp $permissions $all $inline-script $inline-font $cookie $network $app $method $redirect $redirect-rule $denyallow $removeparam $removeheader $hls $jsonprune noop $empty (deprecated) $mp4 (deprecated) These modifiers are able to completely change the behaviour of basic rules. $important {#important-modifier} The $important modifier applied to a rule increases its priority over any other rule without $important modifier. Even over basic exception rules. Examples ! blocking rule will block all requests despite of the exception rule ||example.org^$important @@||example.org^ ! if the exception rule also has `$important` modifier it will prevail, so no requests will not be blocked ||example.org^$important @@||example.org^$important ! if a document-level exception rule is applied to the document, the `$important` modifier will be ignored; ! so if a request to `example.org` is sent from the `test.org` domain, the blocking rule will not be applied despite it has the `$important` modifier ||example.org^$important @@||test.org^$document $badfilter {#badfilter-modifier} The rules with the $badfilter modifier disable other basic rules to which they refer. It means that the text of the disabled rule should match the text of the $badfilter rule (without the $badfilter modifier). Examples ||example.com$badfilter disables ||example.com ||example.com$image,badfilter disables ||example.com$image @@||example.com$badfilter disables @@||example.com ||example.com$domain=domain.com,badfilter disables ||example.com$domain=domain.com Rules with $badfilter modifier can disable other basic rules for specific domains if they fulfill the following conditions: The rule has a $domain modifier. The rule does not have a negated domain ~ in $domain modifier value. In that case, the $badfilter rule will disable the corresponding rule for domains specified in both the $badfilter and basic rules. Please note that wildcard-TLD logic works here as well. Examples /some$domain=example.com|example.org|example.io is disabled for example.com by /some$domain=example.com,badfilter /some$domain=example.com|example.org|example.io is disabled for example.com and example.org by /some$domain=example.com|example.org,badfilter /some$domain=example.com|example.org and /some$domain=example.io are disabled completely by /some$domain=example.com|example.org|example.io,badfilter /some$domain=example.com|example.org|example.io is disabled completely by /some$domain=example.*,badfilter /some$domain=example.* is disabled for example.com and example.org by /some$domain=example.com|example.org,badfilter /some$domain=example.com|example.org|example.io is NOT disabled for example.com by /some$domain=example.com|~example.org,badfilter because the value of $domain modifier contains a negated domain Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with $badfilter modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. $replace {#replace-modifier} This modifier completely changes the rule behavior. If it is applied, the rule will not block the request. The response is going to be modified instead. You will need some knowledge of regular expressions to use $replace modifier. Features $replace rules apply to any text response, but will not apply to binary (media, image, object, etc). $replace rules do not apply if the size of the original response is more than 3MB. $replace rules have a higher priority than other basic rules (including exception rules). So if a request corresponds to two different rules one of which has the $replace modifier, this rule will be applied. Document-level exception rules with $content or $document modifiers do disable $replace rules for requests matching them. Other document-level exception rules ($generichide, $elemhide or $jsinject modifiers) are applied alongside $replace rules. It means that you can modify the page content with a $replace rule and disable cosmetic rules there at the same time. $replace value can be empty in the case of exception rules. See examples section for further information. Multiple rules matching a single request In case if multiple $replace rules match a single request, we will apply each of them. The order is defined alphabetically. Syntax In general, $replace syntax is similar to replacement with regular expressions in Perl. replace = ""/"" regexp ""/"" replacement ""/"" modifiers regexp — a regular expression. replacement — a string that will be used to replace the string corresponding to regexp. modifiers — a regular expression flags. For example, i — insensitive search, or s — single-line mode. In the $replace value, two characters must be escaped: comma , and dollar sign $. Use backslash \ for it. For example, an escaped comma looks like this: \,. Examples ||example.org^$replace=/(<VAST[\s\S]*?>)[\s\S]*<\/VAST>/\$1<\/VAST>/i There are three parts in this rule: regexp - (<VAST(.|\s)*?>)(.|\s)*<\/VAST>; replacement — \$1<\/VAST> where $ is escaped; modifiers — i for insensitive search. You can see how this rule works here: http://regexr.com/3cesk Multiple $replace rules ||example.org^$replace=/X/Y/ ||example.org^$replace=/Z/Y/ @@||example.org/page/*$replace=/Z/Y/ Both rule 1 and 2 will be applied to all requests sent to example.org.

Disabling $replace rules @@||example.org^$replace will disable all $replace rules matching ||example.org^. @@||example.org^$document or @@||example.org^$content will disable all $replace rules originated from pages of example.org including the page itself. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with $replace modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android, and AdGuard Browser extension for Firefox. Such rules do not work in extensions for other browsers because they are unable to modify content on the network level. Restrictions Rules with $replace modifier can be used only in trusted filters. $csp {#csp-modifier} This modifier completely changes the rule behavior. If it is applied to a rule, it will not block the matching request. The response headers are going to be modified instead. In order to use this type of rules, it is required to have the basic understanding of the Content Security Policy security layer. For the requests matching a $csp rule, we will strengthen response security policy by enhancing the content security policy, similar to the content security policy of the $csp modifier contents. $csp rules are applied independently from any other rule type. Other basic rules have no influence on it save for document-level exceptions (see the examples section below). Multiple rules matching a single request In case if multiple $csp rules match a single request, we will apply each of them. Syntax $csp value syntax is similar to the Content Security Policy header syntax. $csp value can be empty in the case of exception rules. See examples section below. Limitations There are a few characters forbidden in the $csp value: ,, $. $csp rules support limited list of modifiers: $domain, $important, $subdocument. Rules with report-* directives are considered invalid. Examples ||example.org^$csp=frame-src 'none' blocks all frames on example.org and its subdomains. @@||example.org/page/*$csp=frame-src 'none' disables all rules with the $csp modifier exactly matching frame-src 'none' on all the pages matching the rule pattern. For instance, the rule above. @@||example.org/page/*$csp disables all the $csp rules on all the pages matching the rule pattern. ||example.org^$csp=script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' http: https: disables inline scripts on all the pages matching the rule pattern. @@||example.org^$document or @@||example.org^$urlblock disables all the $csp rules on all the pages matching the rule pattern. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with $csp modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari. $permissions {#permissions-modifier} This modifier completely changes the rule behavior. If it is applied to a rule, it will not block the matching request. The response headers are going to be modified instead. In order to use this type of rules, it is required to have the basic understanding of the Permissions Policy security layer. For the requests matching a $permissions rule, AdGuard strengthens response's permissions policy by adding additional permission policy equal to the $permissions modifier contents. $permissions rules are applied independently from any other rule type. Other basic rules have no influence on it save for document-level exceptions (see the examples section). Multiple rules matching a single request. In case if multiple $permissions rules match a single request, AdGuard will apply each of them. Syntax $permissions value syntax is similar to the Permissions-Policy header syntax with one exception: comma that separates several features MUST be escaped — see examples below. The list of the available directives is available here. $permissions value can be empty in the case of exception rules — see examples below. Limitations Characters forbidden in the $permissions value: $; $permissions is compatible with the limited list of modifiers: $domain, $important, and $subdocument. Examples ||example.org^$permissions=sync-xhr=() disallows synchronous XMLHttpRequest requests across example.org. @@||example.org/page/*$permissions=sync-xhr=() disables all rules with the $permissions modifier exactly matching sync-xhr=() on all the pages matching the rule pattern. For instance, the rule above. @@||example.org/page/*$permissions disables all the $permissions rules on all the pages matching the rule pattern. $domain=example.org|example.com,permissions=oversized-images=()\, sync-script=()\, unsized-media=() disallows oversized images, synchronous scripts and unsized media features across example.org and example.com. @@||example.org^$document or @@||example.org^$urlblock disables all the $permission rules on all the pages matching the rule pattern. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with the $permissions modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.11 or later. $all {#all-modifier} $all modifier is made of $document, $popup, $csp modifiers. E.g. rule ||example.org^$all is converting into such set of rules: ||example.org^$document,popup ||example.org^$csp=script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' http: https: data: blob: mediastream: filesystem: ||example.org^$csp=font-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' http: https: data: blob: mediastream: filesystem: ||example.org^ $inline-script {#inline-script-modifier} $inline-script modifier is a sort of a shortcut for $csp modifier with specific value. E.g. the rule ||example.org^$inline-script is converting into such a rule: ||example.org^$csp=script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' http: https: data: blob: mediastream: filesystem: $inline-font {#inline-font-modifier} $inline-font modifier is a sort of a shortcut for $csp modifier with specific value. E.g. the rule ||example.org^$inline-font is converting into such a rule: ||example.org^$csp=font-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' http: https: data: blob: mediastream: filesystem: $cookie {#cookie-modifier} The $cookie modifier completely changes rule behavior. Instead of blocking a request, this modifier makes us suppress or modify the Cookie and Set-Cookie headers. Multiple rules matching a single request In case if multiple $cookie rules match a single request, we will apply each of them one by one. Syntax $cookie [= name[; maxAge = seconds [; sameSite = strategy ]]] where: name — optional, string or regular expression to match cookie name. seconds — number of seconds for current time to offset the expiration date of cookie. strategy — string for Same-Site strategy to make cookie use. For example, ||example.org^$cookie=NAME;maxAge=3600;sameSite=lax every time AdGuard encounters a cookie called NAME in a request to example.org, it will do the following: Set its expiration date to current time plus 3600 seconds Makes the cookie use Same-Site ""lax"" strategy. Escaping special characters If regular expression name is used for matching, two characters must be escaped: comma , and dollar sign $. Use backslash \ escape each of them. For example, escaped comma looks like this: \,. Examples ||example.org^$cookie blocks all cookies set by example.org; this is an equivalent to setting maxAge=0 $cookie=__cfduid blocks CloudFlare cookie everywhere $cookie=/__utm[a-z]/ blocks Google Analytics cookies everywhere ||facebook.com^$third-party,cookie=c_user prevents Facebook from tracking you even if you are logged in $cookie rules are not affected by regular exception rules (@@) unless it is a $document exception.

How it works: @@||example.org^$cookie unblocks all cookies set by example.org @@||example.org^$cookie=concept unblocks a single cookie named concept @@||example.org^$cookie=/^_ga_/ unblocks every cookie that matches the regular expression Limitations $cookie rules support a limited list of modifiers: $domain, $~domain, $important, $third-party, $~third-party. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with $cookie modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari. $network {#network-modifier} This is basically a Firewall-kind of rules allowing to fully block or unblock access to a specified remote address. $network rules match IP addresses only! You cannot use them to block or unblock access to a domain. To match an IPv6 address, you have to use the collapsed syntax, e.g. use [2001:4860:4860::8888]$network instead of [2001:4860:4860:0:0:0:0:8888]$network. An allowlist $network rule makes AdGuard bypass data to the matching endpoint, e.g. there will be no further filtering at all. If the IP part starts and ends with / character, it is treated as a regular expression. We recommend to get acquainted with this article, for better understanding of regular expressions. Examples 174.129.166.49:3478^$network blocks access to 174.129.166.49:3478 (but not to 174.129.166.49:34788). [2001:4860:4860::8888]:443^$network blocks access to [2001:4860:4860::8888]:443. 174.129.166.49$network blocks access to 174.129.166.49:*. @@174.129.166.49$network makes AdGuard bypass data to the endpoint. No other rules will be applied. /.+:3[0-9]{4}/$network blocks access to any port from 30000 to 39999. /8.8.8.(:?8|4)/$network blocks access to both 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.8.4. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Only AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android are technically capable of using rules with $network modifier. $app {#app-modifier} This modifier lets you narrow the rule coverage down to a specific application (or a list of applications). This might be not too important on Windows and Mac, but this is very important on mobile where some of the filtering rules must be application-specific. Android — use the app package name, e.g. org.example.app. Windows — use the process name, e.g. chrome.exe. Mac — use the bundle ID or the process name, e.g. com.google.Chrome. For Mac, you can find out the bundle ID or the process name of the app by viewing the respective request details in the Filtering log. Examples ||baddomain.com^$app=org.example.app — a rule to block requests that match the specified mask, and are sent from the org.example.app Android app. ||baddomain.com^$app=org.example.app1|org.example.app2 — the same rule, but it works for both org.example.app1 and org.example.app2 apps. If you want the rule not to be applied to certain apps, start the app name with ~ sign. ||baddomain.com^$app=~org.example.app — a rule to block requests that match the specified mask, and are sent from any app save for the org.example.app. ||baddomain.com^$app=~org.example.app1|~org.example.app2 — same as above, but now two apps are excluded: org.example.app1 and org.example.app2. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Only AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android are technically capable of using rules with $app modifier. $method {#method-modifier} This modifier limits the rule scope to requests that use the specified set of HTTP methods. Negated methods are allowed. The methods must be specified in all lowercase characters, but are matched case-insensitively. Examples ||evil.com^$method=get|head blocks only GET and HEAD requests to evil.com. ||evil.com^$method=~post|~put blocks any requests except POST or PUT to evil.com. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard $method is available starting with CoreLibs v1.12. $redirect {#redirect-modifier} AdGuard is able to redirect web requests to a local ""resource"". Syntax AdGuard uses the same filtering rules syntax as uBlock Origin. Also, it is compatible with ABP $rewrite=abp-resource modifier. $redirect is a modifier for the basic filtering rules so rules with this modifier support all other basic modifiers like $domain, $third-party, $script, etc. The value of the $redirect modifier must be the name of the resource that will be used for redirection. $redirect rules' priority is higher than the regular basic blocking rules' priority. This means that if there is a basic blocking rule (even with $important modifier), $redirect rule will prevail over it. If there is an allowlist (@@) rule matching the same URL, it will disable redirecting as well (unless the $redirect rule is also marked as $important). Disabling $redirect rules ||example.org/script.js$script,redirect=noopjs — this rule redirects all requests to example.org/script.js to the resource named noopjs. ||example.org/test.mp4$media,redirect=noopmp4-1s — this rule redirects all requests to example.org/test.mp4 to the resource named noopmp4-1s. @@||example.org^$redirect will disable all $redirect rules for URLs that match ||example.org^. @@||example.org^$redirect=nooptext will disable all rules with $redirect=nooptext for any request that matches ||example.org^. More information on redirects and their usage is available on GitHub. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with $redirect modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari. $redirect-rule {#redirect-rule-modifier} This is basically an alias to $redirect since it has the same ""redirection"" values and the logic is almost similar. The difference is that $redirect-rule is applied only in the case when the target request is blocked by a different basic rule. Negating $redirect-rule works exactly the same way as for regular $redirect rules. Even more than that, @@||example.org^$redirect will negate both $redirect and $redirect-rule rules. Examples ||example.org/script.js ||example.org^$redirect-rule=noopjs In this case, only requests to example.org/script.js will be ""redirected"" to noopjs. All other requests to example.org will be kept intact. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with $redirect-rule modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari. $denyallow {#denyallow-modifier} $denyallow modifier allows to avoid creating additional rules when it is needed to disable a certain rule for specific domains. $denyallow matches only target domains and not referrer domains. Adding this modifier to a rule is equivalent to excluding the domains by the rule's matching pattern or to adding the corresponding exclusion rules. To add multiple domains to one rule, use the | character as a separator. Restrictions The rule's matching pattern cannot target any specific domains, e.g. it cannot start with ||. Domains in the modifier value cannot be negated, e.g. $denyallow=~x.com, or have a wildcard TLD, e.g. $denyallow=x.*. The rules which violate these restrictions are considered invalid. Examples This rule: *$script,domain=a.com|b.com,denyallow=x.com|y.com is equivalent to this one: /^(?!.*(x.com|y.com)).*$/$script,domain=a.com|b.com or to the combination of these three: *$script,domain=a.com|b.com @@||x.com$script,domain=a.com|b.com @@||y.com$script,domain=a.com|b.com Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with $denyallow modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. $removeparam {#removeparam-modifier} $queryprune is an alias of $removeparam. Since $queryprune is deprecated, avoid using it and use $removeparam instead. Rules with $removeparam modifier are intended to strip query parameters from requests' URLs. Please note that such rules are only applied to GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, and sometimes POST requests. $removeparam rules that do not have any content type modifiers will match only requests where content type is document. Syntax Basic syntax $removeparam=param — removes query parameter with the name param from URLs of any request, e.g. a request to http://example.com/page?param=1&another=2 will be transformed to http://example.com/page?another=2. $removeparam basic syntax is supported starting with v1.7 of CoreLibs and v3.6 of AdGuard Browser Extension. Regular expressions You can also use regular expressions to match query parameters and/or their values: $removeparam=/regexp/[options] — removes query parameters that matches the regexp regular expression from URLs of any request. Unlike basic syntax, it means ""remove query parameters normalized to a name=value string which match the regexp regular expression"". [options] here is the list of regular expression options. At the moment, the only supported option is i which makes matching case-insensitive. $removeparam syntax for regular expressions will be supported starting with v1.8 of CoreLibs and v4.0 of AdGuard Browser Extension. For now, use the simplified version: $removeparam=param. Escaping special characters Do not forget to escape special characters like ,, / and $ in the regular expressions. Use \ character for that purpose. For example, an escaped comma should look like this: \,. Note Regexp-type rules target both name and value of the parameter. In order to minimize the chance of mistakes, it is safer to start every regexp with /^ unless you specifically target parameter values. We will try to detect and ignore unescaped $ automatically using a simple rule of thumb: It is not an options delimiter if all three are true: It looks like $/; There is another slash character / to the left of it; There is another unescaped dollar sign $ to the left of that slash character. Remove all query parameters Specify naked $removeparam to remove all query parameters: ||example.org^$removeparam — removes all query parameters from URLs matching ||example.org^. Inversion Use ~ to apply inversion: $removeparam=~param — removes all query parameters with the name different from param. $removeparam=~/regexp/ — removes all query parameters that do not match the regexp regular expression. Negating $removeparam This sort of rules work pretty much the same way it works with $csp and $redirect modifiers. Use @@ to negate $removeparam: @@||example.org^$removeparam negates all $removeparam rules for URLs that match ||example.org^. @@||example.org^$removeparam=param negates the rule with $removeparam=param for any request matching ||example.org^. @@||example.org^$removeparam=/regexp/ negates the rule with $removeparam=/regexp/ for any request matching ||example.org^. Multiple rules matching a single request In the case when multiple $removeparam rules match a single request, each of them will be applied one by one. Examples $removeparam=/^(utm_source|utm_medium|utm_term)=/ $removeparam=/^(utm_content|utm_campaign|utm_referrer)=/ @@||example.com^$removeparam With these rules some UTM parameters will be stripped out from any request, except that requests to example.com will not be stripped at all, e.g. http://google.com/page?utm_source=s&utm_referrer=fb.com&utm_content=img will be transformed to http://google.com/page, but http://example.com/page?utm_source=s&utm_referrer=fb.com&utm_content=img will not be affected by the blocking rule. $removeparam=utm_source — removes utm_source query parameter from all requests. $removeparam=/utm_.*/ — removes all utm_* query parameters from URL queries of any request, e.g. a request to http://example.com/page?utm_source=test will be transformed to http://example.com/page. $removeparam=/^utm_source=campaign$/ — removes utm_source query parameter with the value equal to campaign. It does not touch other utm_source parameters.

Compatibility with other modifiers $removeparam rules are compatible with basic modifiers, content type modifiers, and with $important and $app modifiers. The rules which have any other modifiers are considered invalid and will be discarded. Note $removeparam rules can also be disabled by $document and $urlblock exception rules. But basic exception rules without modifiers do not do that. For example, @@||example.com^ will not disable $removeparam=p for requests to example.com, but @@||example.com^$urlblock will. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard {#removeparam-modifier-compatibility} Rules with $removeparam modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android, and AdGuard browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, Edge. POST request types are supported only by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.10 or later. Restrictions Rules with $removeparam modifier can be used only in trusted filters. $removeheader {#removeheader-modifier} Rules with $removeheader modifier are intended to remove headers from HTTP requests and responses. The initial motivation for this rule type is to be able to get rid of the Refresh header which is often used to redirect users to an undesirable location. However, this is not the only case where this modifier can be useful. Just like $csp, $redirect, $removeparam, and $cookie, this modifier exists independently, rules with it do not depend on the regular basic rules, i.e. regular exception or blocking rules will not affect it. By default, it only affects response headers. However, you can also change it to remove headers from HTTP requests as well. Syntax Basic syntax ||example.org^$removeheader=header-name removes a response header called header-name ||example.org^$removeheader=request:header-name removes a request header called header-name $removeheader is case-insensitive, but we suggest always using lower case. Negating $removeheader This type of rules works pretty much the same way it works with $csp and $redirect modifiers. Use @@ to negate $removeheader: @@||example.org^$removeheader negates all $removeheader rules for URLs that match ||example.org^. @@||example.org^$removeheader=header negates the rule with $removeheader=header for any request matching ||example.org^. $removeheader rules can also be disabled by $document and $urlblock exception rules. But basic exception rules without modifiers will not do that. For example, @@||example.com^ will not disable $removeheader=p for requests to example.com, but @@||example.com^$urlblock will. Multiple rules matching a single request In case of multiple $removeheader rules matching a single request, we will apply each of them one by one. Restrictions This type of rules can be used only in trusted filters. In order to avoid compromising the security $removeheader cannot remove headers from the list below: access-control-allow-origin access-control-allow-credentials access-control-allow-headers access-control-allow-methods access-control-expose-headers access-control-max-age access-control-request-headers access-control-request-method origin timing-allow-origin allow cross-origin-embedder-policy cross-origin-opener-policy cross-origin-resource-policy content-security-policy content-security-policy-report-only expect-ct feature-policy origin-isolation strict-transport-security upgrade-insecure-requests x-content-type-options x-download-options x-frame-options x-permitted-cross-domain-policies x-powered-by x-xss-protection public-key-pins public-key-pins-report-only sec-websocket-key sec-websocket-extensions sec-websocket-accept sec-websocket-protocol sec-websocket-version p3p sec-fetch-mode sec-fetch-dest sec-fetch-site sec-fetch-user referrer-policy content-type content-length accept accept-encoding host connection transfer-encoding upgrade $removeheader rules are not compatible with any other modifiers except $domain, $third-party, $app, $important, $match-case, and content type modifiers, e.g. $script, $stylesheet, etc. The rules which have any other modifiers are considered invalid and will be discarded. Examples ||example.org^$removeheader=refresh removes Refresh header from all HTTP responses returned by example.org and its subdomains. ||example.org^$removeheader=request:x-client-data removes X-Client-Data header from all HTTP requests.

They are intended as a convenient way to remove segments from HLS playlists (RFC 8216). Note The word ""segment"" in this document means either a ""Media Segment"" or a ""playlist"" as part of a ""Master Playlist"": $hls rules do not distinguish between a ""Master Playlist"" and a ""Media Playlist"". Syntax ||example.org^$hls=urlpattern removes segments whose URL matches the URL pattern urlpattern. The pattern works just like the one in basic URL rules, however, the characters /, $ and , must be escaped with \ inside urlpattern. ||example.org^$hls=/regexp/options removes segments where the URL or one of the tags (for certain options, if present) is matched by the regular expression regexp. Available options are: t — instead of testing the segment's URL, test each of the segment's tags against the regular expression. A segment with a matching tag is removed; i — make the regular expression case-insensitive. The characters /, $ and , must be escaped with \ inside regexp. Exceptions Basic URL exceptions shall not disable rules with $hls modifier. They can be disabled as described below: @@||example.org^$hls disables all $hls rules for responses from URLs matching ||example.org^. @@||example.org^$hls=text disables all $hls rules with the value of the $hls modifier equal to text for responses from URLs matching ||example.org^. $hls rules can also be disabled by $document, $content and $urlblock exception rules. Restrictions $hls rules are only allowed in trusted filters. $hls rules are not compatible with any other modifiers except $domain, $third-party, $app, $important, $match-case, and $xmlhttprequest. $hls rules only apply to HLS playlists, which are UTF-8 encoded text starting with the line #EXTM3U. Any other response will not be modified by these rules. $hls rules do not apply if the size of the original response is more than 3 MB. Note When multiple $hls rules match the same request, their effect is cumulative. Examples ||example.org^$hls=\/videoplayback^?*&source=dclk_video_ads removes all segments with the matching URL. ||example.org^$hls=/\/videoplayback\/?\?.*\&source=dclk_video_ads/i achieves more or less the same with a regular expression instead of a URL pattern. ||example.org^$hls=/#UPLYNK-SEGMENT:.*\,ad/t removes all segments which have the matching tag. Anatomy of an HLS playlist A quick summary of the specification: An HLS playlist is a collection of text lines. A line may be empty, a comment (starts with #), a tag (also starts with #, can only be recognized by name) or a URL. A URL line is called a ""segment"". Tags may apply to a single segment, i.e. the first URL line after the tag, to all segments following the tag and until the tag with the same name, or to the whole playlist. Some points specific to the operation of $hls rules: When a segment is removed, all of the tags that apply only to that segment are also removed. When there is a tag that applies to multiple segments, and all of those segments are removed, the tag is also removed. Since there is no way to recognize different kinds of tags by syntax, we recognize all of the tags specified by the RFC, plus some non-standard tags that we have seen in the field. Any lines starting with # and not recognized as a tag are passed through without modification, and are not matched against the rules. We do not match tags that apply to the whole playlist, and $hls rules can not be used to remove them, since $hls rules are intended for removing segments. If you know what you are doing, you can use $replace rules to remove or rewrite just a single tag from the playlist. An example of a transformation done by the rules: Original response #EXTM3U #EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:10 #EXTINF,5 preroll.ts #UPLYNK-SEGMENT:abc123,ad #UPLYNK-KEY:aabb1122 #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY #EXTINF,10 01.ts #EXTINF,10 02.ts #UPLYNK-SEGMENT:abc123,segment #UPLYNK-KEY:ccdd2233 #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY #EXTINF,10 01.ts #EXTINF,10 02.ts #EXT-X-ENDLIST Applied rules ||example.org^$hls=preroll ||example.org^$hls=/#UPLYNK-SEGMENT:.*\,ad/t Modified response #EXTM3U #EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:10 #UPLYNK-SEGMENT:abc123,segment #UPLYNK-KEY:ccdd2233 #EXT-X-DISCONTINUITY #EXTINF,10 01.ts #EXTINF,10 02.ts #EXT-X-ENDLIST Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with the $hls modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.10 or later. $jsonprune {#jsonprune-modifier} $jsonprune rules modify the response to a matching request by removing JSON items that match a modified JSONPath expression. They do not modify responses which are not valid JSON documents. In AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.11 or later, $jsonprune also supports modifying JSONP (padded JSON) documents. Syntax ||example.org^$jsonprune=expression removes items that match the modified JSONPath expression expression from the response. Due to the way rule parsing works, the characters $ and , must be escaped with \ inside expression. The modified JSONPath syntax has the following differences from the original: Script expressions are not supported. The supported filter expressions are: ?(has <key>) — true if the current object has the specified key. ?(key-eq <key> <value>) — true if the current object has the specified key, and its value is equal to the specified value. ?(key-substr <key> <value>) — true if the specified value is a substring of the value of the specified key of the current object. Whitespace outside of double- or single-quoted strings has no meaning. Both double- and single-quoted strings can be used. Expressions ending with .. are not supported. Multiple array slices can be specified in square brackets. There are various online tools that make working with JSONPath expressions more convenient: https://www.site24x7.com/tools/jsonpath-finder-validator.html https://jsonpathfinder.com/ https://jsonpath.com/ Keep in mind, though, that all JSONPath implementations have unique features/quirks and are subtly incompatible with each other. Exceptions Basic URL exceptions shall not disable rules with $jsonprune modifier. They can be disabled as described below: @@||example.org^$jsonprune disables all $jsonprune rules for responses from URLs matching ||example.org^. @@||example.org^$jsonprune=text disable all $jsonprune rules with the value of the $jsonprune modifier equal to text for responses from URLs matching ||example.org^. $jsonprune rules can also be disabled by $document, $content and $urlblock exception rules.

Note When multiple $jsonprune rules match the same request, they are sorted in lexicographical order, the first rule is applied to the original response, and each of the remaining rules is applied to the result of applying the previous one. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with the $jsonprune modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.10 or later. Examples ||example.org^$jsonprune=\$..[one\, ""two three""] removes all occurrences of the keys ""one"" and ""two three"" anywhere in the JSON document. Input { ""one"": 1, ""two"": { ""two three"": 23, ""four five"": 45 } } Output { ""two"": { ""four five"": 45 } } ||example.org^$jsonprune=\$.a[?(has ad_origin)] removes all children of a that have an ad_origin key.

Rules with $empty are converting into $redirect=nooptext now. Usually, blocked requests look like a server error to browser. If you use $empty modifier, AdGuard will emulate a blank response from the server with 200 OK status. Examples ||example.org^$empty returns an empty response to all requests to example.org and all subdomains. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with $empty modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari. $mp4 (deprecated) {#mp4-modifier} Deprecation notice This modifier is deprecated in favor of the $redirect modifier. Rules with $mp4 are converting into $redirect=noopmp4-1s,media now. As a response to blocked request AdGuard returns a short video placeholder. Examples ||example.com/videos/$mp4 blocks all video downloads from ||example.com/videos/* and changes the response to a video placeholder. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with $mp4 modifier are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker, AdGuard for iOS and Safari. Non-basic rules However, the capabilities of the basic rules may not be sufficient to block ads. Sometimes you need to hide an element or change part of the HTML code of a web page without breaking anything. The rules described in this section are created specifically for this purpose. Cosmetic rules {#cosmetic-rules} Work with non-basic rules requires the basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. So, if you want to learn how to make such rules, we recommend to get acquainted with this documentation. Element hiding rules {#cosmetic-elemhide-rules} Element hiding rules are used to hide the elements of web pages. It is similar to applying { display: none; } style to selected element. Element hiding rules may operate differently depending on the platform. Syntax {#non-basic-rules-modifiers-syntax} rule = [domains] ""##"" selector domains = [domain0, domain1[, ...[, domainN]]] selector — CSS selector, defines the elements to be hidden. domains — domain restriction for the rule. If you want to limit the rule application area to certain domains, just enter them separated with commas. For example: example.org,example.com##selector. This rule will be also applied to all subdomains of example.org and example.com. If you want the rule not to be applied to certain domains, start a domain name with ~ sign. For example: ~example.org##selector. You can use both approaches in a single rule. For example, example.org,~subdomain.example.org##domain will work for example.org and all subdomains, except subdomain.example.org. Note Element hiding rules are not dependent on each other. If there is a rule example.org##selector in the filter and you add ~example.org##selector both rules will be applied independently. Examples example.com##div.textad — hides a div with a class textad at example.com and all subdomains. example.com,example.org###adblock — hides an element with attribute id equals adblock at example.com, example.org and all subdomains. ~example.com##.textad — hides an element with a class textad at all domains, except example.com and its subdomains. Limitations Safari does not support both permitted and restricted domains. So the rules like example.org,~foo.example.org##.textad are invalid in AdGuard for Safari. Exceptions Exceptions can disable some rules on particular domains. They are very similar to usual exception rules, but instead of ## you have to use #@#. For example, there is a rule in filter: ##.textad If you want to disable it for example.com, you can create an exception rule: example.com#@#.textad Sometimes, it may be necessary to disable all restriction rules. For example, to conduct tests. To do this, use the exclusion rule without specifying a domain. It will completely disable matching CSS elemhide rule on ALL domains: #@#.textad The same can be achieved by adding this rule: *#@#.textad We recommend to use this kind of exceptions only if it is not possible to change the hiding rule itself. In other cases it is better to change the original rule, using domain restrictions. CSS rules {#cosmetic-css-rules} Sometimes, simple hiding of an element is not enough to deal with advertising. For example, blocking an advertising element can just break the page layout. In this case AdGuard can use rules that are much more flexible than hiding rules. With this rules you can basically add any CSS styles to the page. Restrictions Styles that lead to loading any resource are forbidden. Basically, it means that you cannot use any <url> type of value in the style. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard CSS rules are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. CSS rules may operate differently depending on the platform. Syntax rule = [domains] ""#$#"" selector ""{"" style ""}"" domains = [domain0, domain1[, ...[, domainN]]] selector — CSS selector, that defines the elements we want to apply the style to. domains — domain restriction for the rule. Same principles as in element hiding rules. style — CSS style, that we want to apply to selected elements. Examples example.com#$#body { background-color: #333!important; } This rule will apply a style background-color: #333!important; to the body element at example.com and all subdomains. Exceptions Just like with element hiding, there is a type of rules that disable the selected CSS style rule for particular domains. Exception rules syntax is almost the same, you just have to change #$# to #@$#. For example, there is a rule in filter: #$#.textad { visibility: hidden; } If you want to disable it for example.com, you can create an exception rule: example.com#@$#.textad { visibility: hidden; } We recommend to use this kind of exceptions only if it is not possible to change the CSS rule itself. In other cases it is better to change the original rule, using domain restrictions. Extended CSS selectors {#extended-css-selectors} Limitations Pseudo-class :has() Pseudo-class :contains() Pseudo-class :matches-css() Pseudo-class :matches-attr() Pseudo-class :matches-property() Pseudo-class :xpath() Pseudo-class :nth-ancestor() Pseudo-class :upward() Pseudo-class :remove() and pseudo-property remove Pseudo-class :is() Pseudo-class :not() Pseudo-class :if-not() (deprecated) CSS 3.0 is not always enough to block ads. To solve this problem AdGuard extends CSS capabilities by adding support for the new pseudo-elements. We have developed a separate open-source library for non-standard element selecting and applying CSS styles with extended properties. The idea of extended capabilities is an opportunity to match DOM elements with selectors based on their own representation (style, text content, etc.) or relations with other elements. There is also an opportunity to apply styles with non-standard CSS properties. Application area Extended selectors can be used in any cosmetic rule, whether they are element hiding rules or CSS rules. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with extended CSS selectors are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. Syntax Regardless of the CSS pseudo-classes you are using in the rule, you can use special markers to force applying these rules by ExtendedCss. It is recommended to use these markers for all extended CSS cosmetic rules so that it was easier to find them. The syntax for extended CSS rules: #?# — for element hiding, #@?# — for exceptions #$?# — for CSS rules, #@$?# — for exceptions We strongly recommend using these markers any time when you use an extended CSS selector. Examples example.org#?#div:has(> a[target=""_blank""][rel=""nofollow""]) — this rule blocks all div elements containing a child node that has a link with the attributes [target=""_blank""][rel=""nofollow""]. The rule applies only to example.org and its subdomains. example.com#$?#h3:contains(cookies) { display: none!important; } — this rule sets the style display: none!important to all h3 elements that contain the word cookies. The rule applies only to example.com and all its subdomains. example.net#?#.banner:matches-css(width: 360px) — this rule blocks all .banner elements with the style property width: 360px. The rule applies only to example.net and its subdomains. example.net#@?#.banner:matches-css(width: 360px) — this rule will disable the previous rule. You can apply standard CSS selectors using the ExtendedCss library by using a rule marker #?#, e.g. #?#div.banner. Learn more about how to debug extended selectors. Note Some pseudo-classes do not require selector before it. Still adding a universal selector * makes an extended selector easier to read, even though it has no effect on the matching behavior. So selector #block :has(> .inner) works exactly like #block *:has(> .inner) but second one is more obvious. Pseudo-class names are case-insensitive, e.g. :HAS() works as :has(). Still the lower-case names are used commonly. ExtendedCss Limitations {#extended-css-limitations} CSS comments and at-rules are not supported. Specific pseudo-class may have its own limitations: :has(), :xpath(), :nth-ancestor(), :upward(), :is(), :not(), and :remove(). Pseudo-class :has() {#extended-css-has} Draft CSS 4.0 specification describes the :has() pseudo-class. Unfortunately, it is not yet supported by all popular browsers. Note Rules with the :has() pseudo-class should use the native implementation of :has() if they use ## marker and if it is possible, i.e. with no other extended selectors inside. To force applying of ExtendedCss rules with :has(), use #?#/#$?# marker explicitly. Compatibility with other pseudo-classes Synonyms :-abp-has() is supported by ExtendedCss for better compatibility. Deprecation notice :if() is no longer supported as a synonym for :has(). Syntax [target]:has(selector) target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any element selector — required, standard or extended CSS selector The pseudo-class :has() selects the target elements that fit to the selector. Also the selector can start with a combinator. A selector list can be set in selector as well. In this case all selectors in the list are being matched for now. In the future it will be fixed for <forgiving-relative-selector-list> as argument. :has() limitations {#extended-css-has-limitations} Usage of the :has() pseudo-class is restricted for some cases (2, 3): disallow :has() inside the pseudos accepting only compound selectors; disallow :has() after regular pseudo-elements. Native :has() pseudo-class does not allow :has(), :is(), :where() inside :has() argument to avoid increasing the :has() invalidation complexity (case 1). But ExtendedCss did not have such limitation earlier and filter lists already contain such rules, so we have not added this limitation to ExtendedCss and allow to use :has() inside :has() as it was possible before. To use it, just force ExtendedCss usage by setting #?#/#$?# rule marker. Native implementation does not allow any usage of :scope inside :has() argument ([1], [2]). Still, there are some such rules in filter lists: div:has(:scope > a) which we continue to support by simply converting them to div:has(> a), as it used to be done previously. Examples div:has(.banner) selects all div elements which include an element with the banner class: <!-- HTML code --> <div>Not selected</div> <div>Selected <span class=""banner"">inner element</span> </div> div:has(> .banner) selects all div elements which include an banner class element as a direct child of div: <!-- HTML code --> <div>Not selected</div> <div>Selected <p class=""banner"">child element</p> </div> div:has(+ .banner) selects all div elements preceding banner class element which immediately follows the div and both are children of the same parent: <!-- HTML code --> <div>Not selected</div> <div>Selected</div> <p class=""banner"">adjacent sibling</p> <span>Not selected</span> div:has(~ .banner) selects all div elements preceding banner class element which follows the div but not necessarily immediately and both are children of the same parent: <!-- HTML code --> <div>Not selected</div> <div>Selected</div> <span>Not selected</span> <p class=""banner"">general sibling</p> div:has(span, .banner) selects all div elements which include both span element and banner class element: <!-- HTML code --> <div>Not selected</div> <div>Selected <span>child span</span> <p class=""banner"">child .banner</p> </div> Compatibility with old syntax Backward compatible syntax for :has() is supported but not recommended. Pseudo-class :contains() {#extended-css-contains} The :contains() pseudo-class principle is very simple: it allows to select the elements that contain specified text or which content matches a specified regular expression. Regexp flags are supported. Note The :contains() pseudo-class uses the textContent element property for matching, not the innerHTML. Compatibility with other pseudo-classes Synonyms :-abp-contains() and :has-text() are supported for better compatibility. Syntax [target]:contains(match) target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any element match — required, string or regular expression for matching element textContent. Regular expression flags are supported. Examples For such DOM: <!-- HTML code --> <div>Not selected</div> <div id=""match"">Selected as IT contains ""banner""</div> <div>Not selected <div class=""banner""></div></div> the element div#match can be selected by any on these extended selectors: ! plain text div:contains(banner) ! regular expression div:contains(/as .* banner/) ! regular expression with flags div:contains(/it .* banner/gi) Note Only the div with id=match is selected because the next element does not contain any text, and banner is a part of code, not a text. Compatibility with old syntax Backward compatible syntax for :contains() is supported but not recommended. Pseudo-class :matches-css() {#extended-css-matches-css} The :matches-css() pseudo-class allows to match the element by its current style properties. The work of the pseudo-class is based on using the Window.getComputedStyle() method. Syntax [target]:matches-css([pseudo-element, ] property: pattern) target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any element pseudo-element — optional, valid standard pseudo-element, e.g. before, after, first-line, etc. property — required, a name of CSS property to check the element for pattern — required, a value pattern that is using the same simple wildcard matching as in the basic url filtering rules OR a regular expression. For this type of matching, AdGuard always does matching in a case-insensitive manner. In the case of a regular expression, the pattern looks like /regexp/. Special characters escaping and unescaping For non-regexp patterns (,),[,] must be unescaped, e.g. :matches-css(background-image:url(data:*)). For regexp patterns \ should be escaped, e.g. :matches-css(background-image: /^url\\(""data:image\\/gif;base64.+/). Restrictions Regexp patterns do not support flags. Examples For such DOM: <!-- HTML code --> <style type=""text/css""> #matched::before { content: ""Block me"" } </style> <div id=""matched""></div> <div id=""not-matched""></div> the div elements with pseudo-element ::before and with specified content property can be selected by any of these extended selectors: ! string pattern div:matches-css(before, content: block me) ! string pattern with wildcard div:matches-css(before, content: block*) ! regular expression pattern div:matches-css(before, content: /block me/) Compatibility with other pseudo-classes Obsolete pseudo-classes :matches-css-before() and :matches-css-after() are no longer recommended but still are supported for better compatibility. Compatibility with old syntax Backward compatible syntax for :matches-css() is supported but not recommended. Pseudo-class :matches-attr() {#extended-css-matches-attr} The :matches-attr() pseudo-class allows to select an element by its attributes, especially if they are randomized. Syntax [target]:matches-attr(""name""[=""value""]) target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any element name — required, simple string or string with wildcard or regular expression for attribute name matching value — optional, simple string or string with wildcard or regular expression for attribute value matching Escaping special characters For regexp patterns "" and \ should be escaped, e.g. div:matches-attr(class=/[\\w]{5}/). Restrictions Regexp patterns do not support flags. Examples div:matches-attr(""ad-link"") selects the element div#target1: <!-- HTML code --> <div id=""target1"" ad-link=""1random23-banner_240x400""></div> div:matches-attr(""data-*""=""adBanner"") selects the element div#target2: <!-- HTML code --> <div id=""target2"" data-1random23=""adBanner""></div> div:matches-attr(*unit*=/^click$/) selects the element div#target3: <!-- HTML code --> <div id=""target3"" random123-unit094=""click""></div> *:matches-attr(""/.{5,}delay$/""=""/^[0-9]*$/"") selects the element #target4: <!-- HTML code --> <div> <inner-random23 id=""target4"" nt4f5be90delay=""1000""></inner-random23> </div> Pseudo-class :matches-property() {#extended-css-property} The :matches-property() pseudo-class allows to select an element by matching its properties. Syntax [target]:matches-property(""name""[=""value""]) target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any element name — required, simple string or string with wildcard or regular expression for element property name matching value — optional, simple string or string with wildcard or regular expression for element property value matching Escaping special characters For regexp patterns "" and \ should be escaped, e.g. div:matches-property(prop=/[\\w]{4}/). Note Regexp patterns are supported in name for any property in chain, e.g. prop./^unit[\\d]{4}$/.type. Restrictions Regexp patterns do not support flags. Examples An element with such properties: divProperties = { id: 1, check: { track: true, unit_2random1: true, }, memoizedProps: { key: null, tag: 12, _owner: { effectTag: 1, src: 'ad.com', }, }, }; can be selected by any of these extended selectors: div:matches-property(check.track) div:matches-property(""check./^unit_.{4,8}$/"") div:matches-property(""check.unit_*""=true) div:matches-property(memoizedProps.key=""null"") div:matches-property(memoizedProps._owner.src=/ad/) For filters maintainers: To check properties of a specific element, do the following: Inspect the page element or select it in Elements tab of browser DevTools. Run console.dir($0) in Console tab. Pseudo-class :xpath() {#extended-css-xpath} The :xpath() pseudo-class allows to select an element by evaluating an XPath expression. Syntax [target]:xpath(expression) target- optional, standard or extended CSS selector expression — required, valid XPath expression :xpath() limitations {#extended-css-xpath-limitations} target can be omitted so it is optional. For any other pseudo-class that would mean ""apply to all DOM nodes"", but in case of :xpath() it just means ""apply to the whole document"", and such applying slows elements selecting significantly. That's why rules like #?#:xpath(expression) are limited to looking inside the body tag. For example, rule #?#:xpath(//div[@data-st-area=\'Advert\']) is parsed as #?#body:xpath(//div[@data-st-area=\'Advert\']). Extended selectors with defined target as any selector — *:xpath(expression) — can still be used but it is not recommended, so target should be specified instead. Works properly only at the end of selector, except for pseudo-class :remove(). Examples :xpath(//*[@class=""banner""]) selects the element div#target1: <!-- HTML code --> <div id=""target1"" class=""banner""></div> :xpath(//*[@class=""inner""]/..) selects the element div#target2: <!-- HTML code --> <div id=""target2""> <div class=""inner""></div> </div> Pseudo-class :nth-ancestor() {#extended-css-nth-ancestor} The :nth-ancestor() pseudo-class allows to lookup the nth ancestor relative to the previously selected element. subject:nth-ancestor(n) subject — required, standard or extended CSS selector n — required, number >= 1 and < 256, distance to the needed ancestor from the element selected by subject Syntax subject:nth-ancestor(n) subject — required, standard or extended CSS selector n — required, number >= 1 and < 256, distance to the needed ancestor from the element selected by subject :nth-ancestor() limitations {#extended-css-nth-ancestor-limitations} The :nth-ancestor() pseudo-class is not supported inside the argument of the :not() pseudo-class. Examples For such DOM: <!-- HTML code --> <div id=""target1""> <div class=""child""></div> <div id=""target2""> <div> <div> <div class=""inner""></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> .child:nth-ancestor(1) selects the element div#target1, div[class=""inner""]:nth-ancestor(3) selects the element div#target2. Pseudo-class :upward() {#extended-css-upward} The :upward() pseudo-class allows to lookup the ancestor relative to the previously selected element. Syntax subject:upward(ancestor) subject — required, standard or extended CSS selector ancestor — required, specification for the ancestor of the element selected by subject, can be set as: number >= 1 and < 256 for distance to the needed ancestor, same as :nth-ancestor() standard CSS selector for matching closest ancestor :upward() limitations {#extended-css-upward-limitations} The :upward() pseudo-class is not supported inside the argument of the :not() pseudo-class. Examples For such DOM: <!-- HTML code --> <div id=""target1"" data=""true""> <div class=""child""></div> <div id=""target2""> <div> <div> <div class=""inner""></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> .inner:upward(div[data]) selects the element div#target1, .inner:upward(div[id]) selects the element div#target2, .child:upward(1) selects the element div#target1, .inner:upward(3) selects the element div#target2. Pseudo-class :remove() and pseudo-property remove {#remove-pseudos} Sometimes, it is necessary to remove a matching element instead of hiding it or applying custom styles. In order to do it, you can use the :remove() pseudo-class as well as the remove pseudo-property. Pseudo-class :remove() can be placed only at the end of a selector. Syntax ! pseudo-class selector:remove() ! pseudo-property selector { remove: true; } selector — required, standard or extended CSS selector :remove() and remove limitations {#extended-css-remove-limitations} The :remove() pseudo-class is limited to work properly only at the end of selector. For applying the :remove() pseudo-class to any element, a universal selector * should be used. Otherwise such extended selector may be considered as invalid, e.g. .banner > :remove() is not valid for removing any child element of banner class element, so it should look like .banner > *:remove(). If the :remove() pseudo-class or the remove pseudo-property is used, all style properties are ignored except for the debug pseudo-property. Examples div.banner:remove() div:has(> div[ad-attr]):remove() div:contains(advertisement) { remove: true; } div[class]:has(> a > img) { remove: true; } Note Rules with the remove pseudo-property should use #$?# marker: $ for CSS style rules syntax, ? for ExtendedCss syntax. Pseudo-class :is() {#extended-css-is} The :is() pseudo-class allows to match any element that can be selected by any of selectors passed to it. Invalid selectors are skipped and the pseudo-class deals with valid ones with no error thrown. Our implementation of the native :is() pseudo-class. Syntax [target]:is(selectors) target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any element selectors — forgiving selector list of standard or extended selectors. For extended selectors only compound selectors are supported, not complex. :is() limitations {#extended-css-is-limitations} Rules with the :is() pseudo-class should use the native implementation of :is() if rules use ## marker and it is possible, i.e. with no other extended selectors inside. To force applying ExtendedCss rules with :is(), use #?#/#$?# marker explicitly. If the :is() pseudo-class argument selectors is an extended selector, due to the way how the :is() pseudo-class is implemented in ExtendedCss v2.0, it is impossible to apply it to the top DOM node which is html, i.e. #?#html:is(<extended-selectors>) does not work. So if target is not defined or defined as a universal selector *, the extended pseudo-class applying is limited to html's children, e.g. rules #?#:is(...) and #?#*:is(...) are parsed as #?#html *:is(...). Please note that there is no such limitation for a standard selector argument, i.e. #?#html:is(.locked) works fine. Complex selectors with extended pseudo-classes are not supported as selectors argument for :is() pseudo-class, only compound ones are allowed. Check examples below for more details. Examples #container *:is(.inner, .footer) selects only the element div#target1: <!-- HTML code --> <div id=""container""> <div data=""true""> <div> <div id=""target1"" class=""inner""></div> </div> </div> </div> Due to limitations :is(*:not([class]) > .banner)' does not work but :is(*:not([class]):has(> .banner)) can be used instead of it to select the element div#target2: <!-- HTML code --> <span class=""span"">text</span> <div id=""target2""> <p class=""banner"">inner paragraph</p> </div> Pseudo-class :not() {#extended-css-not} The :not() pseudo-class allows to select elements which are not matched by selectors passed as argument. Invalid argument selectors are not allowed and error is to be thrown. Our implementation of the :not() pseudo-class. Syntax [target]:not(selectors) target — optional, standard or extended CSS selector, can be missed for checking any element selectors — list of standard or extended selectors :not() limitations {#extended-css-not-limitations} Rules with the :not() pseudo-class should use the native implementation of :not() if rules use ## marker and it is possible, i.e. with no other extended selectors inside. To force applying ExtendedCss rules with :not(), use #?#/#$?# marker explicitly. If the :not() pseudo-class argument selectors is an extended selector, due to the way how the :not() pseudo-class is implemented in ExtendedCss v2.0, it is impossible to apply it to the top DOM node which is html, i.e. #?#html:not(<extended-selectors>) does not work. So if target is not defined or defined as a universal selector *, the extended pseudo-class applying is limited to html's children, e.g. rules #?#:not(...) and #?#*:not(...) are parsed as #?#html *:not(...). Please note that there is no such limitation for a standard selector argument, i.e. #?#html:not(.locked) works fine. The :not() is considered as a standard CSS pseudo-class inside the argument of the :upward() pseudo-class because :upward() supports only standard selectors. ""Up-looking"" pseudo-classes which are :nth-ancestor() and :upward() are not supported inside selectors argument for :not() pseudo-class. Examples #container > *:not(h2, .text) selects only the element div#target1: <!-- HTML code --> <div id=""container""> <h2>Header</h2> <div id=""target1""></div> <span class=""text"">text</span> </div> Pseudo-class :if-not() (deprecated) {#extended-css-if-not} Deprecation notice The :if-not() pseudo-class is deprecated and is no longer supported. Rules with it are considered as invalid. This pseudo-class was basically a shortcut for :not(:has()). It was supported by ExtendedCss for better compatibility with some filters subscriptions. Cosmetic rules priority {#cosmetic-rules-priority} The way element hiding and CSS rules are applied is platform-specific. In AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, we use a stylesheet injected into the page. The priority of cosmetic rules is the same as any other websites' CSS stylesheet. But there is a limitation: element hiding and CSS rules cannot override inline styles. In such cases, it is recommended to use extended selectors or HTML filtering. In AdGuard Browser extension, the so called ""user stylesheets"" are used. They have higher priority than even the inline styles. Extended CSS selectors use JavaScript to work and basically add an inline style themselves, therefore they can override any style. HTML filtering rules {#html-filtering-rules} In most cases, the basis and cosmetic rules are enough to filter ads. But sometimes it is necessary to change the HTML-code of the page itself before it is loaded. This is when you need filtering rules for HTML content. They allow to indicate the HTML elements to be cut out before the browser loads the page. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard HTML filtering rules are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android, and AdGuard Browser extension for Firefox. Such rules do not work in extensions for other browsers because they are unable to modify content on network level. Syntax rule = [domains] ""$$"" tagName [attributes] domains = [domain0, domain1[, ...[, domainN]]] attributes = ""["" name0 = value0 ""]"" ""["" name1 = value2 ""]"" ... ""["" nameN = valueN ""]"" tagName — name of the element in lower case, for example, div or script. domains — domain restriction for the rule. Same principles as in element hiding rules syntax. attributes — a list of attributes, that limit the elements selection. name — attribute name, value — substring, that is contained in attribute value. Examples HTML code: <script data-src=""/banner.js""></script> Rule: example.org$$script[data-src=""banner""] This rule removes all script elements with the attribute data-src containing the substring banner. The rule applies only to example.org and all its subdomains. Special attributes In addition to usual attributes, which value is every element checked for, there is a set of special attributes that change the way a rule works. Below there is a list of these attributes: tag-content This is the most frequently used special attribute. It limits selection with those elements whose innerHTML code contains the specified substring. You should use """" to escape "", for instance: $$script[tag-content=""alert(""""this is ad"""")""] For example, take a look at this HTML code: <script type=""text/javascript""> document.write('<div>banner text</div>"" />'); </script> Following rule will delete all script elements with a banner substring in their code: $$script[tag-content=""banner""] Nested elements If we are dealing with multiple nested elements and they all fall within the same HTML filtering rule, they all are going to be deleted. wildcard This special attribute works almost like tag-content and allows you to check the innerHTML code of the document. Rule will check if HTML code of the element fits to the search pattern. You should use """" to escape "", for instance: $$script[wildcard=""""banner""""] For example: $$script[wildcard=""*banner*text*""] It will check, if the code of element contains two consecutive substrings banner and text. max-length Specifies the maximum length for content of HTML element. If this parameter is set and the content length exceeds the value, a rule does not apply to the element. Default value If this parameter is not specified, the max-length is considered to be 8192. For example: $$div[tag-content=""banner""][max-length=""400""] This rule will remove all the div elements, whose code contains the substring banner and the length of which does not exceed 400 characters. min-length Specifies the minimum length for content of HTML element. If this parameter is set and the content length is less than preset value, a rule does not apply to the element. For example: $$div[tag-content=""banner""][min-length=""400""] This rule will remove all the div elements, whose code contains the substring banner and the length of which exceeds 400 characters. Exceptions Similar to hiding rules, there is a special type of rules that disable the selected HTML filtering rule for particular domains. The syntax is the same, you just have to change $$ to $@$. For example, there is a rule in filter: $$script[tag-content=""banner""] If you want to disable it for example.com, you can create an exception rule: example.com$@$script[tag-content=""banner""] Sometimes, it may be necessary to disable all restriction rules. For example, to conduct tests. To do this, use the exclusion rule without specifying a domain. $@$script[tag-content=""banner""] We recommend to use this kind of exceptions only if it is not possible to change the hiding rule itself. In other cases it is better to change the original rule, using domain restrictions. JavaScript rules {#javascript-rules} AdGuard supports a special type of rules that allows you to inject any javascript code to websites pages. Restrictions JavaScript rules can be used only in trusted filters. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard JavaScript rules are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. We strongly recommend using scriptlets instead of JavaScript rules whenever possible. JS rules are supposed to help with debugging, but as a long-time solution a scriptlet rule should be used. Syntax rule = [domains] ""#%#"" script domains — domain restriction for the rule. Same principles as in element hiding rules. script — arbitrary javascript code in one string. Examples example.org#%#window.__gaq = undefined; executes the code window.__gaq = undefined; on all pages at example.org and all subdomains. Exceptions Similar to hiding rules, there is a special type of rules that disable the selected javascript rule for particular domains. The syntax is the same, you just have to change #%# to #@%#. For example, there is a rule in filter: #%#window.__gaq = undefined; If you want to disable it for example.com, you can create an exception rule: example.com#@%#window.__gaq = undefined; Sometimes, it may be necessary to disable all restriction rules. For example, to conduct tests. To do this, use the exclusion rule without specifying a domain. #@%#window.__gaq = undefined; We recommend to use this kind of exceptions only if it is not possible to change the hiding rule itself. In other cases it is better to change the original rule, using domain restrictions. Scriptlet rules {#scriptlets} Scriptlet is a JavaScript function that provides extended capabilities for content blocking. These functions can be used in a declarative manner in AdGuard filtering rules. Restrictions Trusted scriptlets rules can be used only in trusted filters. Note AdGuard supports a lot of different scriptlets. In order to achieve cross-blocker compatibility, we also support syntax of uBO and ABP. Syntax rule = [domains] ""#%#//scriptlet("" scriptletName arguments "")"" scriptletName — required, a name of the scriptlet from AdGuard's Scriptlets library arguments — optional, a list of string arguments (no other types of arguments are supported) Examples example.org#%#//scriptlet(""abort-on-property-read"", ""alert"") This rule will be applied to example.org and subdomains pages and will execute the abort-on-property-read scriptlet with the alert parameter. Learn more about how to debug scriptlets. More information about scriptlets can be found on GitHub. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Scriptlet rules are not supported by AdGuard Content Blocker. Trusted scriptlets {#trusted-scriptlets} Trusted scriptlets are scriptlets with extended functionality. It means the same syntax and restrictions. Trusted scriptlet names are prefixed with trusted-, e.g. trusted-set-cookie, to be easily distinguished from common scriptlets. Note Trusted scriptlets are not compatible with other ad blockers except AdGuard Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Trusted scriptlets rules are now supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.10.141 or later. Learn more about how to debug scriptlets. More information about trusted scriptlets can be found on GitHub. Modifiers for non-basic type of rules $app $domain $path $url Each rule can be modified using the modifiers described in the following paragraphs. Syntax rule = ""[$"" modifiers ""]"" [rule text] modifiers = modifier0[, modifier1[, ...[, modifierN]]] modifier — set of the modifiers described below. rule text — a rule to be modified. For example, [$domain=example.com,app=test_app]##selector. In the modifiers values of the following characters must be escaped: [, ], ,, and \ (unless it is used for the escaping). Use \ to escape them. For example, an escaped bracket looks like this: \]. $app {#non-basic-app-modifier} $app modifier lets you narrow the rule coverage down to a specific application or a list of applications. The modifier's behavior and syntax perfectly match the corresponding basic rules $app modifier. Examples [$app=org.example.app]example.com##.textad hides a div with a class textad at example.com and all subdomains in requests sent from the org.example.app Android app. [$app=~org.example.app1|~org.example.app2]example.com##.textad hides a div with a class textad at example.com and all subdomains in requests sent from any app except org.example.app1 and org.example.app2. [$app=com.apple.Safari]example.org#%#//scriptlet('prevent-setInterval', 'check', '!300') applies scriptlet prevent-setInterval only in Safari browser on Mac. [$app=org.example.app]#@#.textad disables all ##.textad rules for all domains while using org.example.app. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Such rules with $app modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac and Android. $domain {#non-basic-domain-modifier} $domain modifier limits the rule application area to a list of domains and their subdomains. The modifier's behavior and syntax perfectly match the corresponding basic rules $domain modifier. Examples [$domain=example.com]##.textad — hides a div with a class textad at example.com and all subdomains. [$domain=example.com|example.org]###adblock — hides an element with attribute id equals adblock at example.com, example.org and all subdomains. [$domain=~example.com]##.textad — this rule hides div elements of the class textad for all domains, except example.com and its subdomains. Please note that there are 2 ways to specify domain restrictions for non-basic rules: the ""classic"" way is to specify domains before rule mask and attributes: example.com##.textad; the modifier approach is to specify domains via $domain modifier: [$domain=example.com]##.textad. But rules with mixed style domains restriction are considered invalid. So, for example, the rule [$domain=example.org]example.com##.textad will be rejected. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Such rules with $domain modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android, and AdGuard Browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Edge. $path {#non-basic-path-modifier} $path modifier limits the rule application area to specific locations or pages on websites. Syntax $path [""="" pattern] pattern — optional, a path mask to which the rule is restricted. Its syntax and behavior are pretty much the same as with the pattern for basic rules. You can also use special characters, except for ||, which does not make any sense in this case (see examples below). If pattern is not set for $path, rule will apply only on the main page of website. $path modifier matches the query string as well. $path modifier supports regular expressions in the same way basic rules do. Examples [$path=page.html]##.textad hides a div with a class textad at /page.html or /page.html?<query> or /sub/page.html or /another_page.html [$path=/page.html]##.textad hides a div with a class textad at /page.html or /page.html?<query> or /sub/page.html of any domain but not at /another_page.html [$path=|/page.html]##.textad hides a div with a class textad at /page.html or /page.html?<query> of any domain but not at /sub/page.html [$path=/page.html|]##.textad hides a div with a class textad at /page.html or /sub/page.html of any domain but not at /page.html?<query> [$path=/page*.html]example.com##.textad hides a div with a class textad at /page1.html or /page2.html or any other path matching /page<...>.html of example.com [$path]example.com##.textad hides a div with a class textad at the main page of example.com [$domain=example.com,path=/page.html]##.textad hides a div with a class textad at page.html of example.com and all subdomains but not at another_page.html [$path=/\\/(sub1|sub2)\\/page\\.html/]##.textad hides a div with a class textad at both /sub1/page.html and /sub2/page.html of any domain (please note the escaped special characters) Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with $path modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android, and AdGuard Browser extension for Chrome, Firefox, Edge. url {#non-basic-url-modifier} $url modifier limits the rule application area to URLs matching the specified mask. Syntax url = pattern where pattern is pretty much the same as pattern of the basic rules assuming that some characters must be escaped. The special characters and regular expressions are supported as well. Examples [$url=||example.com/ads/*]##.textad hides a div with a class textad at addresses like http://example.com/ads/banner.jpg and even http://subdomain.example.com/ads/otherbanner.jpg. [$url=||example.org^]###adblock hides an element with attribute id equal to adblock at example.org and its subdomains. [$url=/\[a-z\]+\\.example\\.com^/]##.textad hides div elements of the class textad for all domains matching the regular expression [a-z]+\.example\.com^. Compatibility with different versions of AdGuard Rules with the $url modifier are supported by AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android, running CoreLibs version 1.11 or later. Information for filters maintainers If you maintain a third-party filter that is known to AdGuard, you might be interested in the information presented in this section. Please note that hints will be applied to registered filters only. The filter is considered to be registered and known by AdGuard, if it is present in the known filters index. If you want your filter to be registered, please file an issue to AdguardFilters repo. Preprocessor directives We provide preprocessor directives that can be used by filters maintainers to improve compatibility with different ad blockers and provide: including a file applying rules conditionally by ad blocker type content blocker specifying for rules applying in Safari Note Any mistake in a preprocessor directive will lead to AdGuard failing the filter update in the same way as if the filter URL was unavailable. Preprocessor directives can be used in the user rules or in the custom filters. Including a file {#include-directive} The !#include directive allows to include contents of a specified file into the filter. It supports only files from the same origin to make sure that the filter maintainer is in control of the specified file. The included file can also contain pre- directives (even other !#include directives). Ad blockers should consider the case of recursive !#include and implement a protection mechanism. Syntax !#include file_path where file_path is a same origin absolute or relative file path to be included. The files must originate from the same domain but may be located in a different folder. If included file is not found or unavailable, the whole filter update should fail. Same-origin limitation should be disabled for local custom filters. Examples Filter URL: https://example.org/path/filter.txt ! Valid (same origin): !#include https://example.org/path/includedfile.txt ! ! Valid (relative path): !#include /includedfile.txt !#include ../path2/includedfile.txt ! ! Invalid (another origin): !#include https://domain.com/path/includedfile.txt Conditions {#conditions-directive} Filters maintainers can use conditions to supply different rules depending on the ad blocker type. When an adblocker encounters an !#if directive, followed eventually by an !#endif directive, it will compile the code inside of the directives block only if the specified condition is true. Condition supports all the basic logical operators. A conditional directive beginning with an !#if directive must explicitly be terminated with an !#endif directive. Whitespaces matter. !#if is a valid directive, while !# if is not. Syntax !#if (conditions) rules_list !#endif where: !#if (conditions) — start of the block conditions — just like in some popular programming languages, preprocessor conditions are based on constants declared by ad blockers. Ad blocker authors define on their own what exact constants do they declare. Possible values: adguard always declared; shows maintainers that this is one of AdGuard products; should be enough in 95% of cases product-specific constants for cases when you need a rule to work (or not work — then ! should be used before constant) in a specific product only: adguard_app_windows — AdGuard for Windows adguard_app_mac — AdGuard for Mac adguard_app_android — AdGuard for Android adguard_app_ios — AdGuard for iOS adguard_ext_safari — AdGuard for Safari adguard_ext_chromium — AdGuard Browser extension for Chrome (and chromium-based browsers, e.g. new Microsoft Edge) adguard_ext_firefox — AdGuard Browser extension for Firefox adguard_ext_edge — AdGuard Browser extension for Edge Legacy adguard_ext_opera — AdGuard Browser extension for Opera adguard_ext_android_cb — AdGuard Content Blocker for mobile Samsung and Yandex browsers ext_ublock — special case; this one is declared when a uBlock version of a filter is compiled by the FiltersRegistry rules_list — list of rules !#endif — end of the block Examples ! for all AdGuard products except AdGuard for Safari !#if (adguard && !adguard_ext_safari) ||example.org^$third-party domain.com##div.ad !#endif ! directives even can be combined !#if (adguard_app_android) !#include /androidspecific.txt !#endif Safari affinity {#safari-affinity-directive} Safari is notoriously known for its harsh 150k max limit for filtering rules in content blockers. But in AdGuard for Safari and AdGuard for iOS max rule count is raised to 300k by splitting them into several content blockers. Generally, several filters categories are more or less independent, so there is such content blockers with such categories included: AdGuard General — Ad Blocking, Language-specific AdGuard Privacy — Privacy AdGuard Social — Social Widgets, Annoyances AdGuard Security — Security AdGuard Other — Other AdGuard Custom — Custom User rules and Allowlist are added to every content blocker. The main issue with using multiple content blockers is that rules inside these content blockers cannot influence each other. This may lead to different unexpected issues. So filters maintainers may use !#safari_cb_affinity to define Safari content blockers affinity for the rules inside of the directive block. Syntax !#safari_cb_affinity(content_blockers) rules_list !#safari_cb_affinity where: !#safari_cb_affinity(content_blockers) — start of the block content_blockers — comma-separated list of content blockers. Possible values: general — AdGuard General content blocker privacy — AdGuard Privacy content blocker social — AdGuard Social content blocker security — AdGuard Security content blocker other — AdGuard Other content blocker custom — AdGuard Custom content blocker all — special keyword that means that the rules must be included into all content blockers rules_list — list of rules !#safari_cb_affinity — end of the block Examples ! to unhide specific element which is hidden by AdGuard Base filter: !#safari_cb_affinity(general) example.org#@#.adBanner !#safari_cb_affinity ! to allowlist basic rule from AdGuard Tracking Protection filter filter: !#safari_cb_affinity(privacy) @@||example.org^ !#safari_cb_affinity Hints ""Hint"" is a special comment, instruction to the filters compiler used on the server side (see FiltersRegistry). Syntax !+ HINT_NAME1(PARAMS) HINT_NAME2(PARAMS) Multiple hints can be applied. NOT_OPTIMIZED hint For each filter, AdGuard compiles two versions: full and optimized. Optimized version is much more lightweight and does not contain rules which are not used at all or used rarely. Rules usage frequency comes from the collected filter rules statistics. But filters optimization is based on more than that — some filters have specific configuration. This is how it looks like for Base filter: ""filter"": AdGuard Base filter, ""percent"": 30, ""minPercent"": 20, ""maxPercent"": 40, ""strict"": true where: filter — filter identifier percent — expected optimization percent ~= (rules count in optimized filter) / (rules count in original filter) * 100 minPercent — lower bound of percent value maxPercent — upper bound of percent value strict — if percent < minPercent OR percent > maxPercent and strict mode is on then filter compilation should fail, otherwise original rules must be used In other words, percent is the ""compression level"". For instance, for the Base filter it is configured to 40%. It means that optimization algorithm should strip 60% of rules. Eventually, here are the two versions of the Base filter for AdGuard Browser extension: full: https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/chromium/filters/2.txt optimized: https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/chromium/filters/2_optimized.txt If you want to add a rule which should not be removed at optimization use the NOT_OPTIMIZED hint: !+ NOT_OPTIMIZED ||example.org^ And this rule will not be optimized only for AdGuard for Android: !+ NOT_OPTIMIZED PLATFORM(android) ||example.org^ PLATFORM and NOT_PLATFORM hints Used to specify the platforms to apply the rules. List of existing platforms and links to Base filter, for example, for each of them: windows — AdGuard for Windows — https://filters.adtidy.org/windows/filters/2.txt mac — AdGuard for Mac — https://filters.adtidy.org/mac_v2/filters/2.txt android — AdGuard for Android — https://filters.adtidy.org/android/filters/2.txt ios — AdGuard for iOS — https://filters.adtidy.org/ios/filters/2.txt ext_chromium — AdGuard Browser extension for Chrome — https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/chromium/filters/2.txt ext_ff — AdGuard Browser extension for Firefox — https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/firefox/filters/2.txt ext_edge — AdGuard Browser extension for Edge — https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/edge/filters/2.txt ext_opera — AdGuard Browser extension for Opera — https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/opera/filters/2.txt ext_safari — AdGuard for Safari — https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/safari/filters/2.txt ext_android_cb — AdGuard Content Blocker — https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/android-content-blocker/filters/2.txt ext_ublock — uBlock Origin — https://filters.adtidy.org/extension/ublock/filters/2.txt Examples This rule will be available only in AdGuard for Windows, Mac, Android: !+ PLATFORM(windows,mac,android) ||example.org^ This rule will be available for every platform except AdGuard for Safari, AdGuard Content Blocker, and AdGuard for iOS: !+ NOT_PLATFORM(ext_safari, ext_android_cb, ios) ||example.org^ How to debug filtering rules It may be possible to create simple filtering rules ""in your head"" but for anything even slightly more complicated you will need additional tools to debug and iterate them. There are tools to assist you with that. You can use DevTools in Chrome and its analogs in other browsers but most AdGuard products provide another one — Filtering log. Filtering log Filtering log is an advanced tool that will be helpful mostly to filter developers. It lists all web requests that pass through AdGuard, gives you exhaustive information on each of them, offers multiple sorting options, and has other useful features. Depending on which AdGuard product you are using, Filtering log can be located in different places. In AdGuard for Windows you will find it inside Ad Blocker tab or via the tray menu; In AdGuard for Mac it is under Settings → Advanced → Filtering log; In AdGuard for Android it is a separate item in the side menu, also filtering log for a specific app or website is accessible from the Assistant. In AdGuard Browser extension it is accessible from the Miscellaneous settings tab or by right-clicking the extension icon. Only Chromium- and Firefox-based browsers show applied element hiding rules (including CSS, ExtCSS) and JS rules and scriptlets in their Filtering logs. In AdGuard for iOS and in AdGuard for Safari Filtering log does not exist because of the way content blockers are implemented in Safari. AdGuard does not see the web requests and therefore cannot display them. Selectors debugging mode {#selectors-debug-mode} Sometimes, you might need to check the performance of a given selector or a stylesheet. In order to do it without interacting with JavaScript directly, you can use a special debug style property. When ExtendedCss meets this property, it enables the debugging mode either for a single selector or for all selectors, depending on the debug value. Open the browser console while on a web page to see the timing statistics for selector(s) that were applied there. Debugging mode displays the following stats as object where each of the debugged selectors are keys, and value is an object with such properties: Always printed: selectorParsed — text of eventually parsed selector timings — list of DOM nodes matched by the selector appliesCount — total number of times that the selector has been applied on the page appliesTimings — time that it took to apply the selector on the page, for each of the instances that it has been applied (in milliseconds) meanTiming — mean time that it took to apply the selector on the page standardDeviation — standard deviation timingsSum — total time it took to apply the selector on the page across all instances Printed only for remove pseudos: removed — flag to signal if elements we removed Printed if elements are not removed: matchedElements — list of DOM nodes matched by the selector styleApplied — parsed rule style declaration related to the selector Examples Debugging a single selector: When the value of the debug property is true, only information about this selector will be shown in the browser console. #$?#.banner { display: none; debug: true; } Enabling global debug: When the value of the debug property is global, the console will display information about all extended CSS selectors that have matches on the current page, for all the rules from any of the enabled filters. #$?#.banner { display: none; debug: global; } Testing extended selectors without AdGuard ExtendedCss can be executed on any page without using any AdGuard product. In order to do that you should copy and execute the following code in a browser console: !function(e,t,d){C=e.createElement(t),C.src=d,C.onload=function(){alert(""ExtendedCss loaded successfully"")},s=e.getElementsByTagName(t)[0],s?s.parentNode.insertBefore(C,s):(h=e.getElementsByTagName(""head"")[0],h.appendChild(C))}(document,""script"",""https://AdguardTeam.github.io/ExtendedCss/extended-css.min.js""); Alternatively, install the ExtendedCssDebugger userscript. Now you can now use the ExtendedCss from global scope, and run its method query() as Document.querySelectorAll(). Examples const selector = 'div.block:has=(.header:matches-css(after, content: Ads))'; // array of HTMLElements matched the `selector` is to be returned ExtendedCss.query(selector); Debugging scriptlets {#debug-scriptlets} If you are using AdGuard Browser extension and want to debug a scriptlet or a trusted scriptlet rule, you can get additional information by opening the Filtering log. In that case, scriptlets will switch to debug mode and there will be more information in the browser console. The following scriptlets are especially developed for debug purposes: debug-current-inline-script debug-on-property-read debug-on-property-write log-addEventListener log-on-stack-trace log-eval log The following scriptlets also may be used for debug purposes: json-prune prevent-fetch prevent-requestAnimationFrame prevent-setInterval prevent-setTimeout prevent-window-open with specified replacement parameter prevent-xhr trusted-replace-fetch-response trusted-replace-xhr-response Good luck with creating filters! We wish you luck with creating you own ad filters. If you need an advice on how to create your own filters properly, our forum has a special section dedicated to writing your own filtering rules. "

62,"Problem description in a nutshell By default, AdGuard uses the ""default route"" which disables iCloud Private Relay. Currently, AdGuard and iCloud Private Relay cannot work at the same time. AdGuard cannot block ads because iCloud Private Relay encrypts traffic before AdGuard can filter network connections. When iCloud Private Relay is active, any filtering (including local filtering) becomes impossible. Thus, AdGuard can't filter traffic or perform DNS filtering in Safari. Yet, AdGuard still filters traffic in other browsers. To keep using iCloud Private Relay, consider installing AdGuard for Safari. The same applies to using any VPN apps on Mac: you have to choose between using iCloud Private Relay or a VPN service. In detail AdGuard for Mac now uses macOS built-in socket filtering based on the network extensions API. This new and rather buggy mechanism replaced good old Kernel extensions. Over the last 1.5 years, we've reported more than 20(!) bugs to Apple regarding their new filtering method. The network extensions API has a VPN-like configuration with a list of route-like entries. On Big Sur, AdGuard developed ""split-tunnel"" rules to avoid creating the ""default route"" rule because it causes problems on early Big Sur releases. On Monterey, iCloud Private Relay got introduced. Privacy features of the Mail app also use Private Relay servers. As a result, AdGuard can't work together with iCloud Private Relay and the Mail app privacy features: iCloud Private Relay is applied to connections at the library level — before they reach the socket level, where AdGuard operates. iCloud Private Relay uses QUIC, which AdGuard can't filter in filtered apps because HTTP/3 filtering is not yet available. As AdGuard blocks QUIC, including iCloud Private Relay traffic — otherwise, ad blocking is impossible. When you use iCloud Private Relay and switch AdGuard into the ""split-tunnel"" mode, you can't open websites in Safari. To work around this issue for Monterey, we apply the ""default route"" rule. When Private Relay sees that rule, it disables itself automatically. So, AdGuard works seamlessly on Monterey, but iCloud Private Relay gets disabled. network.extension.monterey.force.split.tunnel restores the ""Big Sur"" behavior, but this option may break access to websites due to (3) and (4). We keep searching for a solution to this issue. One of the options is implementing HTTP/3 filtering. Recommended solution We recommend using AdGuard together with a more traditional VPN service such as AdGuard VPN. Alternative solution You can prevent AdGuard from using the ""default route"" by disabling the ""default route"". It can be done via Advanced Settings → network.extension.monterey.force.split.tunnel. Bear in mind that, in this case, you'll face the issues described above. "
63,"System requirements Operating system version: macOS 10.13 (64 bit) or higher RAM: at least 2 GB Browsers: Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Yandex.Browser, and any other macOS compatible browser Free disk space: 120 MB Installation To install AdGuard for macOS on your computer, launch your browser, type adguard.com in the address bar, and press Download on the page that opens.

64,"AdGuard for Windows and AdGuard VPN for Windows compatibility issues Once you install AdGuard for Windows and AdGuard VPN for Windows, they just start working together without any effort on your part. However, changing some of their default settings may cause the apps to work incorrectly when they run at the same time. There are two specific settings in AdGuard for Windows: Use redirect driver mode and Filter localhost. By default, the first is disabled, and the second is enabled. Changing any of these settings will inevitably disrupt AdGuard's filtering if both AdGuard Ad Blocker and AdGuard VPN are enabled on your device. Changing these settings is only necessary to resolve issues related to the simultaneous operation of AdGuard Ad Blocker and network-level apps such as antiviruses, VPNs, and network filters. If you come across a situation where you need to change the default state of the above settings and still want AdGuard Ad Blocker and AdGuard VPN to work simultaneously and correctly — create an issue on GitHub so we can help you personally. We are currently working on overcoming the above-listed limitations of the simultaneous work of our apps. "
65,"To be able to filter HTTPS-traffic and efficiently block ads and trackers, AdGuard generates a special (and unique) root certificate and installs it into the system storage. You can learn more about why a certificate is required by reading this article. Normally browsers trust the AdGuard certificate once it's added to the system certificate storage during the installation process. But in some cases this is not enough and you may come across warnings or errors. This happens most often in Firefox-based browsers like Mozilla Firefox, PaleMoon, Waterfox, etc., or in Yandex.Browser. Potential Security Risk error in Firefox-based browsers Old FireFox versions, as well as browsers based on them, do not trust certificates from the system storage, but only those from their local storage. Since v68, FireFox trusts the system certificates, but you still can face the ""Connection is untrusted"" error. If something like this happens, first try to click the Reinstall Certificate button — you will find it in the Network tab. If that doesn't help, follow the instructions for manually adding the AdGuard certificate to the FireFox storage. This instruction is for Firefox browser. Names of buttons and menu items may differ in other Firefox-based browsers. Run AdGuard. Go to http://local.adguard.org/cert and click the Download button. The browser should start downloading cert.cer file. You can also open the download page by clicking on the link via the AdGuard app at Settings → Network → HTTPS filtering. Open your browser and then open Settings. Go to Privacy & Security tab. Scroll down to Certificates and click the View Certificates button. Select Authorities tab. Click Import.... Browse the downloaded cert.cer file and click Open. Check the Trust this CA to identify websites box and then lick OK. You've successfully installed AdGuard certificate. Restart the browser and the error should go away. Yandex.Browser certificate warning If you are a user of both AdGuard for Windows and Yandex.Browser you may have come across this warning: Why is this happening Both AdGuard and Yandex take users' security on the Internet very seriously. Current Yandex policy is to warn their users about any certificate that is not recognized by the browser. This is not unsubstantiated, because sometimes malicious apps can inject their own certificates and use this to harm the system and steal private data. However, AdGuard also adds its certificate to the trusted ones. This leads to the warning message you have encountered. How to solve the problem The easiest way is to click the Go to site button. This will tell Yandex.Browser to remember AdGuard certificate as a trusted one, at least for a while. Normally, you won't have to see this message anymore, but it is not beyond the realm of possibility for it to appear occasionally, for whatever reasons. In such cases, simply press the same button again (make sure it is AdGuard's certificate!). Disabling the HTTPS filtering in AdGuard will also prevent Yandex.Browser from showing this message again, but it comes with a big price: all ads that are loaded by HTTPS (including Yandex's own ads) will show up — on such websites as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, and many more. We strongly advise against it if you want to keep the quality of ad blocking high. "

68,"This article is about the filters we create to use in AdGuard and other ad-blocking software (e.g., uBlock Origin). Filters are sets of rules in text format used by AdGuard apps and programs to filter out advertising and privacy-threatening content such as banners, pop-ups, or trackers. Filters contain lists of rules based on their purpose. Language filters include rules for corresponding language segments of the Internet (e.g., German filter). Task-based filters group rules that fulfil a specific task, such as Social media filter or Tracking Protection filter. Enabling or disabling a filter makes it easier to work with the entire list of rules at once. AdGuard filters Base filter removes ads from websites with English content. Originally based on EasyList and modified by us. View rules Tracking Protection filter — comprehensive list of various online counters and web analytics tools. Use it to hide your actions online and avoid tracking. View rules URL Tracking filter enhances privacy by removing tracking parameters from URLs. When a user opts to block tracking parameters in Stealth Mode, this filter will be enabled automatically. View rules Social media filter removes numerous ""Like"" and ""Tweet"" buttons and other social media integrations on popular websites. View rules Annoyances filter blocks irritating elements on web pages. View rules Includes the following AdGuard filters (all of them can be enabled separately from the Annoyances filter): Cookie Notices blocks cookie notices on web pages. View rules Popups blocks all kinds of pop-ups that are not necessary for websites' operation. View rules Mobile App Banners blocks banners that promote mobile apps of websites. View rules Widgets blocks third-party widgets: online assistants, live support chats, etc. View rules Other Annoyances blocks elements that do not fall under the popular categories of annoyances.

69,"AdGuard provides a range of software products that block ads and trackers on different platforms. One of the most popular AdGuard products is a free extension that works in five popular browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, and Yandex Browser. Browser extensions include basic ad-blocking features but cannot be compared with full-featured desktop programs, such as AdGuard for Windows and AdGuard for Mac. Availability {#br-extension} AdGuard Browser extension is available for most major browsers. You can easily find it in your browser’s online store or on our official website. We have a standalone extension for Safari. Since the release of Safari 13, most of the ad-blocking extensions have experienced huge issues and many of them stopped functioning. We had to develop a separate extension for Safari that has some differences in comparison with the extension described in this article. Do not forget that the functionality of each extension is strictly limited by the browser’s capabilities. So if you want to get full-fledged protection, consider installing a standalone program for your computer. There's a reason why. Ad blocking {#adblocker} Blocking ads is clearly the key functionality of any ad blocker, and AdGuard is not an exception. The extension will successfully block ads on any page in your browser. Ad blocking is based on so-called filter lists, or simply filters. Filters can be enabled or disabled in your extension's settings. You can customize ad blocking by activating specific filters. Filters {#filters} In essence, filter lists are sets of rules written in a special language. Your ad blocker interpretes the rules and implements them. As a result, you stop seeing ads on your webpages. All filters are grouped according to their role. For example, there are categories for ad-blocking filters, privacy protection filters, social media-related filters, etc. You can enable either individual filters or the entire group at once. Custom filters {#custom} While the features of other filter groups are more or less predictable, there is a group called Custom that may raise additional questions. In this tab, you can add filters that are not present in the extension by default. There are plenty of publicly available filters on the Internet. Moreover, you can create and add your own filters. In fact, you can build any set of filters and customize ad blocking the way you like. To add a filter, just click Add custom filter, enter the URL or the file path of the filter you want to be added and click Next. User rules {#user-rules} User rules is another tool that helps you customize the blocking of ads. There are several ways to add new rules. The most straightforward is to just type a rule in, but it requires some knowledge of the rule syntax. You can import a ready-to-use filter list from a text file as well. Make sure that different rules are separated by line breaks. Note that importing a ready-to-use filter list is better done in the Custom filters tab. Besides, you can export your own filtering rules. This option is good for transferring your list of rules between browsers or devices. When you add a website to the Allowlist (more on that below) or use the Assistant tool for hiding an element on the page, a corresponding rule is also saved in User rules. Allowlist {#allowlist} The allowlist is used to exclude certain websites from filtering. Blocking rules are not applied to the websites on the list. The allowlist can be inverted, too: you can unblock ads everywhere except on the websites added to this list. To do that, activate the Invert allowlist option. You can also import and export existing allowlists. It is useful, for instance, if you want to apply the same allowing rules in each of your browsers. Stealth Mode {#stealth-mode} Stealth Mode aims to ensure the protection of sensitive personal data from online trackers and fraudsters. In Stealth Mode, you can prevent a website from seeing the search queries from you used to find it on the Internet, automatically delete third-party and website’s own cookies, etc. A separate article is devoted to all these features. Note that some of the Stealth Mode options available in full-fledged apps are not present in the browser extensions due to technical restrictions. Other features and options {#other} Apart from the large key modules of AdGuard Browser extension, there are several more specific features that can be configured in the General and Additional settings tabs of the extension settings. General {#general} In the General tab, you can allow search ads and the self-promotion of websites, enable the automatic activation of language-specific filters, indicate the filters update interval, etc. Besides, here you can enable Phishing and malware protection. You can save your settings configuration by clicking the Export settings button. The settings will be saved as a .json file. To upload the previously saved settings configuration, use the Import settings function. You can even use it to quickly switch between different settings profiles or even to transfer settings configurations between different browsers. Additional settings {#misc} The Additional settings section contains a range of various settings that are related to the ad blocking process and application usability. From this tab, you can activate optimized filters, enable notifications about extension updates, open the Filtering log, or clear the statistics of blocked ads and trackers. Besides, you can opt to help us with the development of filters by sending the statistics on applied rules: which ones are triggered, on which websites, and how often. This option is disabled by default as we do not collect user data without consent. Yet, if you enable it, all data will be strictly anonymized. About {#about} In the About section, you can find infos about the current version, links to the EULA and Privacy policy, and to the repository of the Browser extension on GitHub. Extension’s main menu {#main-menu} The extension's main page can be accessed by clicking on the extension's icon on the toolbar of your browser. On the main page, you can hide any element on any page manually (a corresponding rule will be added to the User rules), open the Filtering log to view the complete information about your browser's traffic and block requests on the go, or look at a website’s security report. Besides, you can submit a complaint about any website (for example, if there are missed ads on the page, our filter engineers will review the report and fix the problem) and see the statistics on applied blocking rules. All web requests made by the browser are displayed in the Filtering log, along with detailed information about each request. The Filtering log makes it easy, for example, to monitor requests blocked by AdGuard Browser extension. Besides, it allows you to block any request or add a previously blocked request to Allowlist in two clicks. The Filtering log also offers you a wide variety of options for sorting web requests, which can be helpful when creating your own filtering rules. You can open the Filtering log by selecting the corresponding item in the main menu, or from the settings page (in the ""Additional settings"" tab). By clicking the icons in the top right corner of the extension's main menu, you can open the extension settings or pause the protection. AdGuard Browser extension vs. standalone apps {#comparison} The main advantage of AdGuard standalone programs over browser extensions is that the programs can block ads in every browser and in almost all apps. You may use different browsers at the same time, the app will filter ads and online threats in all of them equally well. The second difference is that the possibilities of extension-based ad blockers are strictly limited by browser guidelines. The browser extensions have to conform to the policies of the browsers, where ad blocking might be restricted. Thus, some types of filtering rules are not supported by the extensions. The functionality of the desktop apps is not limited, so they have a better filtering quality. Whereas AdGuard Browser extension is free and easy to install, and has filters to block ads and fight online threats, the full-fledged apps are more powerful and have a list of advanced features. See all the differences in the comparative table below. 1 – within browser restrictions and only in the browser where it is installed; 2 – the extension is unable to detect requests from other extensions. If a malicious or tracking extension sends a request to its server to show you ads or track your activity, AdGuard Browser extension will not be able to block that request; 3 – not all types of ads and threats can be blocked by browser extensions due to certain browser limitations. Some elements may get to the page and slow down the loading process. Besides, unlike browser-based ad blockers, the AdGuard app blocks ads before they are loaded to the browser. This saves traffic and speeds up page loading. "
70,"In some cases, apps won't stay in the background (""alive"" or in a sleep mode) due to the Android OS optimization function, or the so-called ""battery save mode"" — this function can kill background apps. It may be inconvenient to relaunch them each time they are getting closed. To avoid the background app termination, you need to follow the steps we described separately for each manufacturer (version) of Android OS. Note that instructions for different manufacturers are mostly very similar. Asus Information on Asus devices is still far from being exhaustive so there may be more issues than listed here. We're going to update this part of the article when we know more. The main source of potential problems with background work on Asus devices is associated with the optimization app called Power Master. It is pre-installed and has pretty aggressive default settings, e.g. to block apps from starting and to kill background tasks when your screen turns off. To make sure apps background processing works, set up the following: Go to Mobile Manager → PowerMaster → Settings (or Battery-saving options) → Uncheck Clean up in suspend Go to Mobile Manager → PowerMaster → Settings (or Battery-saving options) → Uncheck Auto-deny apps from auto starting Alternatively, instead of unchecking Auto-deny apps from auto starting entirely, you can go to Settings → Battery-saving options → Auto-start manager → AdGuard and uncheck it. Xiaomi Xiaomi (and especially MIUI) devices are among the most troublesome ones when it comes to background work. They are known to limit background processes and have non-standard permissions with a lack of proper documentation to top it off. Sometimes apps just don't work right on Xiaomi phones and there's little that can be done about that. Below are some actions you might attempt to perform if you run into any trouble regarding AdGuard's background work on various Xiaomi devices. MIUI 12.0.8+ To let your AdGuard app run successfully in the background, do the following: In Settings → Apps → Manage apps → scroll down to locate AdGuard, set Autostart to ""On"". Scroll down to Battery saver, tap it, and set to ""No restrictions"". In Other Permissions, set all possible permissions to ""On"" Run the Security app. Tap on the Gear icon at the top-right corner of the screen. Tap Boost speed in Feature Settings. Tap Lock apps. In the Lock apps screen, set the toggle switch for the AdGuard app to On. That’s all! You’ve successfully pinned the AdGuard app. MIUI 12 Go to Settings → Apps → Manage apps → AdGuard. Set Autostart to ""On"" Set all possible permissions in Other Permissions to ""On"" Set Battery saver to No restrictions Now launch the active apps manager by swiping up from the bottom of the screen and look for the AdGuard app. Tap and hold it until a special menu pops up. Select a lock icon. The lock icon should appear above the app window. MIUI 10-11 To let your app run successfully in the background, configure its settings as follows: Set Autostart to ""On"" Settings → Battery & performance → switch-off Battery saver function Then open App battery saver settings → AdGuard → No restrictions All models The following steps should be performed on any Xiaomi device that keeps killing the AdGuard app: Power management Please enable: Settings → Advanced Settings → Battery manager → set Power plan to Performance Device Settings → Advanced Settings → Battery Manager → Protected apps – AdGuard needs to be Protected Device Settings → Apps → AdGuard → Battery → Power-intensive prompt and Keep running after screen off Settings → Additional Settings → Battery & Performance → Manage apps’ battery usage and here: Switch Power Saving Modes to ""Off"" Choose the following options: Saving Power in The Background → Choose apps → AdGuard → Background Settings → No restrictions App battery saver Set Security → Battery → App Battery Saver → AdGuard to No restriction App pinning To set up AdGuard's background work for Xiaomi devices you should pay attention to Battery and Permissions. Tap the Recent tasks button and swipe AdGuard down to make options visible (as shown on the screenshot): Tap on the lock icon. This will stop Xiaomi from closing AdGuard automatically. It should look like this: Go to Battery Select the battery saver app Find and select AdGuard Set up the following Background settings: Go to Permissions Select Autostart Make sure that autostart function is enabled for AdGuard: Samsung On many Samsung devices, any app that is unused for 3 days will not be able to start from background. You should turn off Adaptive battery and Put apps to sleep options wherever possible to prevent that. Note that after an app or OS update, these settings often revert to their default values and will need to be turned off again. Android 11+ On Android 11, Samsung will prevent apps (including AdGuard) from working in background by default unless you exclude them from battery optimizations. To make sure AdGuard will not get killed in the background: Lock AdGuard in Recent Open Recent apps. Find AdGuard. Long-press the icon of the AdGuard app. To keep AdGuard working properly: Go to Settings → Apps → AdGuard → Battery → Optimize battery usage In the drop-down menu, select All. Then find AdGuard on the list and set the state for it to Don’t optimize (on some models, there may be a switch that you need to toggle off). On some devices, the relevant setting may be named differently and be located in other places. Among the possible paths is: Settings → Apps → (⁝) menu → Special Access → Optimize battery usage → Find AdGuard on the list and uncheck it Disable automatic optimization. To do so: Open Battery → (⁝) menu → Choose Automation → Toggle off all of the settings there Again, the exact path may differ, for example on some devices you should go to: Phone Settings → Device care → Tap the (⁝) 3-dot menu → Advanced → Disable Auto optimization and Optimize settings If your phone has it, disable Adaptive battery: Open phone Settings → Battery → More battery settings → Toggle off Adaptive battery Disable Sleeping apps (the exact name of this setting and the path to it may vary depending on the device): Open phone Settings → Battery → Background usage limits → Disable Put unused apps to sleep Android 9 & 10 Go to Phone settings → Device care → Tap on the Battery item → (⁝) 3-dot menu → Settings and uncheck Put unused apps to sleep and Auto-disable unused apps. Check that Phone settings → Apps → Sleep as Android → Battery → Background restriction is set to App can use battery in background for AdGuard. Remove AdGuard from Sleeping apps. To do that: Go to Phone settings → Device care Tap Battery Tap the 3-dot menu → Settings Tap Sleeping apps Wake up AdGuard using the trashcan icon Old Samsung devices For early Samsung devices, there is no huge need for setting up the background operation, but if in your case the AdGuard app is getting closed or disappears from the recent tasks after a while, do the following: Tap the Recent tasks button, tap the Additional settings icon. It should look like this: Tap Lock Apps: Tap on the lock icon Huawei Huawei and their Android customization EMUI belongs to the most troublesome on the market with respect to non-standard background process limitations. On default settings, virtually all apps that work in background will face problems and ultimately break. App Launch on some EMUI 8, 9 and 10 devices (Huawei P20, Huawei P20 Lite, Huawei Mate 10…) This feature may or may not be available for all devices or may be labeled differently. Go to phone Settings → Battery → App launch Turn off Manage all automatically Set AdGuard to Manage manually and enable all toggles. Disable Startup manager that prevents apps from running automatically after the phone starts up. Go to Settings → All → Startup manager → Toggle AdGuard off Also for reliable background processes you may need to uninstall PowerGenie as detailed below. EMUI 9+ devices and PowerGenie Note: On phones with EMUI 9+ (Android P+) there is a task killer app called PowerGenie which forces to quit all apps not whitelisted by Huawei and does not give users any configuration options. See below how to uninstall it. Huawei is extremely inventive in breaking apps on their devices. In addition to all the non-standard power management measures described below, they introduced a task killer app built right into EMUI 9 on Android Pie. It is called PowerGenie and it kills all apps that are not on its whitelist. You cannot add custom apps on their pre-defined whitelist. This means there is no other way to achieve proper app functionality on Huawei than uninstalling PowerGenie. Unfortunately, this is a system app that can only be fully uninstalled using ADB (Android Debug Bridge). Source: XDA forum. You need to: It is not confirmed, but it might be possible to just disable PowerGenie in Phone settings → Apps. If this setting is present in your device's settings, you may skip the following steps. However, it would need to be re-applied every time you reboot your device. If there is no such setting, follow this instruction: Install ADB on your computer; Connect your phone with a data cable; Enable Developer options; Enable USB debugging within Developer options on your phone; Run the following commands on your computer: adb shell pm uninstall --user 0 com.huawei.powergenie adb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 com.huawei.android.hwaps If AdGuard keeps getting killed, also try running adb shell pm stopservice hwPfwService EMUI 6+ devices (and some EMUI 5 devices): Phone settings → Advanced Settings → Battery manager → Power plan set to Performance; Phone Settings → Advanced Settings → Battery Manager → Protected apps – set AdGuard as Protected; Phone Settings → Apps → Your app → Battery → Power-intensive prompt [uncheck] and Keep running after screen off [check]; Phone settings → Apps → Advanced (At the bottom) → Ignore optimizations → Press Allowed → All apps → Find AdGuard on the list and set to Allow. Huawei P9 Plus: Open device settings → Apps → Settings → Special access → choose Ignore battery optimization → select Allow for AdGuard. Huawei P20, Huawei Honor 9 Lite and Huawei Mate 9 Pro: Open device settings → Battery → App launch> then set AdGuard to Manage manually and make sure everything is turned on. Huawei P20, Huawei P20 Lite, Huawei Mate 10: Phone settings → Battery → App launch and then set AdGuard to Manage manually and make sure everything is turned on. Also for reliable background processes you may need to uninstall PowerGenie as described above. Early Huawei Old Huawei devices are the easiest to set up, it is enough to perform two simple steps to lock AdGuard in the background so it won't be terminated by battery saving or background killer process. Tap the Recent tasks button: Tap on the lock icon: Besides, to set up the background work of AdGuard more effectively, you should open device settings and do the following: Go to Settings → open Battery Manager → set Power plan to Performance; Then choose Protected apps in the Battery Manager and check if AdGuard is Protected; Go to Apps in the main settings and click AdGuard there → choose Battery → enable Power-intensive prompt and Keep running after screen is off; Then in the Apps section open Settings (at the bottom) → Special access → choose Ignore battery optimization → press Allowed → All apps → find AdGuard on the list and set it to Deny. Meizu Meizu has almost the same approach to the background process limitations as Huawei and Xiaomi. So you can avoid disabling the background work of AdGuard and any other app by adjusting the following settings: Go to Advanced Settings → open Battery Manager → set Power plan to Performance; Then choose Protected apps in the Battery Manager and check if AdGuard is Protected; Go to Apps section and click AdGuard there → choose Battery → enable Power-intensive prompt and Keep running after screen is off. Nokia Nokia devices running Android 9+ have The Evenwell Power saver disabled, which was the main culprit for killing bacground processes. If AdGuard still gets killed on your Nokia phone, check out the legacy instruction. Nokia 1 (Android Go) Install ADB on your computer; Connect your phone with a data cable; Enable Developer options; Enable USB debugging within Developer options on your phone; Uninstall the com.evenwell.emm package via the following adb commands: adb shell pm uninstall --user 0 com.evenwell.emm Nokia 3.1 and 5.1 On these devices there is a task killer called DuraSpeed that terminates all background apps. It can't be uninstalled or disabled by regular means. These actions require ADB, and even then, when disabled, DuraSpeed will re-enable itself on reboot. You need a tasker app like MacroDroid for automatic DuraSpeed's disabling. Install ADB on your computer; Connect your phone with a data cable; Enable Developer options; Enable USB debugging within Developer options on your phone; Grant MacroDroid (or your choice of automation app) the ability to write to the global settings store by entering this command: adb shell pm grant com.arlosoft.macrodroid android.permission.WRITE_SECURE_SETTINGS Create a task triggered at Device Boot that performs the following: System Setting: type Global, name setting.duraspeed.enabled, value -1 System Setting: type System, name setting.duraspeed.enabled, value -1 System Setting: type Global, name setting.duraspeed.enabled, value 0 System Setting: type System, name setting.duraspeed.enabled, value 0 NOTE: You need both Global and System type settings. The screenshot shows only Global as an example. Other Nokia models Go to phone Settings → Apps → See all apps. Tap on the right top corner menu → Show system. Find Power saver app on the list, select it and tap Force close. It will remain stopped for a while but will restart at some point. From now on, AdGuard should work normally and use the standard Android battery optimizations until Power Saver restarts. An alternative, more permanent solution for more tech-savvy users: Install ADB on your computer; Connect your phone with a data cable; Enable Developer options; Enable USB debugging within Developer options on your phone; Uninstall the com.evenwell.powersaving.g3 package via the following adb commands: adb shell pm uninstall --user 0 com.evenwell.powersaving.g3 Oppo Sometimes background services are being killed (including accessibility services, which then need re-enabling) when you turn the screen off. So far, a workaround for this is: Go to Security Centre → tap Privacy Permissions → Startup manager and allow AdGuard app to run in background. Other solutions: Pin AdGuard to the recent apps screen Enable AdGuard in the app list inside the security app’s ""startup manager"" and ""floating app list"" (com.coloros.safecenter / com.coloros.safecenter.permission.Permission) Turn off battery optimizations OnePlus Devices with OxygenOS on board are the most problematic, with its OS-specific cache cleaning and free RAM, including OS optimization. In addition, OxygenOS can interrupt the AdGuard's work if you do not use it for a while. To avoid these unwanted consequences, follow these steps. Locking the app Go to Settings Battery → Battery optimization Find AdGuard Tap on it and select Don't optimize option Tap Done to save Open recent apps menu (as showed on this screenshot): Lock AdGuard app: On some OnePlus phones there is also a thing called App Auto-Launch and Deep Optimization which essentially prevents apps from working in the background. Please disable it for AdGuard. Battery optimization Open device settings → Battery → Battery optimization → switch to the All apps list (top menu) → choose AdGuard → activate Don’t optimize Open device settings → Battery → Battery Optimization → (⁝) three-dot menu → Advanced Optimization → Disable Deep Optimization App Auto-Launch App Auto-Launch (on some OnePlus phones) essentially prevents apps from working in the background. Please disable it for AdGuard. Enhanced / Advanced optimization For OnePlus 6 and above: Open System settings → Battery → Battery optimization → (⁝) three-dot menu → Advanced optimization Disable Deep optimization / Adaptive Battery Disble Sleep standby optimization. OnePlus tries to learn when you are usually asleep, and in those times it will then disable the phone’s network connections. This setting will prevent push notifications from being delivered. For OnePlus below 6: Turn off System settings → Battery → Battery optimization → (⁝) three-dot menu → Enhanced optimization. Recent apps clearing behaviour Normally when you swipe an app away, it won’t close. On OnePlus this may however work in a different way. Recent app clear behaviour manager might be set up in a way that swiping the app to close will kill it. To return it to the ""normal"" mode: Go to Settings → Advanced → Recent app management → Switch to Normal clear Sony Sony was the first mobile OS developer to introduce non-standard background process optimization. It is called Stamina mode and it instantly breaks all background processes if enabled. To solve this: Go to Settings → Battery → Disable STAMINA mode On Android 11+, on the same screen with STAMINA mode, there is a setting called Adaptive battery, you should disable it too. You also need to be set AdGuard as Excepted from Power-saving feature: System settings ​→ Apps & Notifications ​→ Advanced ​→ Special app access ​→ Power saving feature → Switch AdGuard to Excepted Wiko Wiko devices are problematic in terms of non-standard background process optimizations. To let AdGuard work in background, do the following: Go to Phone Assistant → Battery → turn off Eco Mode Go back and go to Manual mode Tap on the Gear icon on top right → Background apps whitelist → Select AdGuard Android stock devices Pixel/Nexus/Essential Android stock OS normally does not conflict with apps working in the background, but if you are facing any issues you will need to switch on the Always-on VPN mode. Go to Settings → Network and Internet Tap VPN and choose AdGuard Set up Always-on VPN mode "
71,"There are a lot of differences between the world’s languages. One of these differences is the use of plural forms that can cause huge difficulties when it comes to localization issue. We strongly recommend you to properly read this article to learn more about plural forms and how they are being used in AdGuard translations. What do plural forms mean? {#plurals} Nouns in different languages can have several plural word forms. Their usage depends on the number of things you are talking about. For instance, English words have two word forms when speaking about something in the singular, like 'one star', and in the plural – 'two stars'. It doesn’t matter if you say five, twenty six or even five hundred thirty two stars – the ending 's' will remain the same. But some languages can contain only one or many plural forms. In contrast to English, the Polish language has three plural forms of nouns. One of them is used when speaking about something in the singular, another form is used in the plural but with numbers ending in 2-4, excluding 12-14, and the third form – for words with other numbers in front of them. Let’s have a look at this picture. Here you can see the groups of numerals which determine a word form when standing in front of it. Find other examples here. Let’s draw a small parallel between English and Polish for better understanding: The English version: The Polish equivalents: 1. form - It takes one hour. 1. form - Zajmuje to godzinę. 2. form - It takes two hours. 2. form - Zajmuje to dwie godziny. 3. form - It takes five hours. 3. form - Zajmuje to pięć godzin. Now it is clear that the Polish 'godzinę' (hour) has three different forms, whereas the English word changes its form with given numbers only twice. Except for Polish, there are a lot of other languages that have three plural forms and more, such as Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Czech etc. But not all of them obey the same rule. That's why it is so important to know how many plural forms your language contains and how you can apply them. Where can you learn about the number of plural forms? {#where-to-learn} When you are faced with a translation that requires the use of plurals, you may not be able to realize right away how many word forms your language contains. Here are some sources of information you can use. Localization Guide contains a wide list of languages. The number of plural forms for different languages is shown this way: 'nplurals=2', 'nplurals=4' and so on. The numeral after the Equals sign '=' means the number of plural forms of the respective language. Also, you can get information about plural forms in the Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR). The CLDR Plural Rules indicate an additional word form for decimal numbers (1.5; 2.3; 100.1…), but we don’t use them in AdGuard translations. Plurals in AdGuard translations {#translations} First of all, we want to mention that not every AdGuard translation requires the use of plural forms. Currently, we have 4 types of strings on Crowdin that involve the use of plurals. Let's take a closer look at them. 1. Phrases with string keys ending in .singular, .dual, .plural {#1type} Most of them are represented in the AdGuard for Windows project and consist of only one or two words: days; extensions; hours Please pay attention to the string keys of such phrases and to the ""Context"" field where you can see some important notes about plurals. The string keys may contain Singular, Dual, Plural words (ex.FormatDayDeclensionDual). In this case, you should leave the appropriate plural form as it is specified in the key. 2. Strings with singular and plural nouns separated by commas {#2type} This kind of strings is mostly concentrated in the AdGuard for Android project. Please look at the example: If there are 3 plural forms of nouns in your language (like in Polish), please write all plural forms separated by commas. hour, hours — godzinę, godziny, godzin In case a noun has only 2 forms, there is no need to write the same form twice (typically only for this type of strings with plurals!). However, it won't be a mistake if you repeat the form twice. 3. Strings that use the Crowdin-developed pattern {#3type} This is the most user-friendly scheme of translating strings with plurals. Crowdin suggests to users that they translate the certain amount of phrases with different plural forms. If your language provides only one plural form, then you will see only one phrase to translate. If three or more forms, Crowdin will provide you with the string divided into other two or three strings to translate. For example: Please be attentive when translating these strings and approving them. If you have no idea what the ""Other"" field means, then just paste the same form as it is in the ""Many"" field. The translations of ""Many"" and ""Other"" fields can be the same. 4. Strings with templates separated by the vertical bar sign {#4type} This is the most complicated type of AdGuard strings which is mostly used in AdGuard Websites project. Pay close attention to a vertical bar sign between the sentences and %count% placeholders in original phrases – this will help you identify phrases where translations require the use of plural forms. Now, let’s imagine — you are faced with such a string: Standard license for %count% computer | Standard license for %count% computers. What should you know to translate it correctly? Let's call the sentences which are divided by a vertical bar sign ""templates"", because actually they serve as templates for phrases with different numbers. Coming back to the example, as the English language includes only two forms, there should be two templates respectively: Standard license for *%count%* computer | Standard license for *%count%* computers where template 1 – Standard license for %count% computer, and template 2 – Standard license for %count% computers Another important thing you should pay your attention to is %count% placeholders that, as usual, take place before the words they define. Instead of %count% here will appear different numbers depending on which templates are being chosen. In a situation with another language that has, let’s say, three plural forms, there should be three templates with two vertical bar signs between them. For example, when we translate the above mentioned phrase into Slovak, that according to the rule of Localization Guide has three word forms, the correct translation will look so: **Štandartná licencia pre *%count%* počítač | Štandartná licencia pre *%count%* počítače | Štandartná licencia pre *%count%* počítačov** In this case, we see three templates which contain three forms of the word ""počítač"" (computer) in Slovak. If we ignore one of the forms and use only two templates for Slovak instead of three, the system won’t be able to take an appropriate template for certain numbers and, as a result, we will have grammar mistakes in sentences, like in English: Standard license for 5 computer. Always use as many forms as there are in your language, even when the word itself has fewer word forms. For example, the Serbian word 'računar' (computer) has only two forms. But there are 3 plural forms in Serbian. Thus, the translation from English into Serbian should be: **Standardna licenca za *%count%* računar | Standardna licenca za *%count%* računara | Standardna licenca za *%count%* računara** Although it is obvious that the last two templates have no differences, it is very important to keep the rule: The number of templates should reflect the number of plural forms of the respective language!(typically for this type of strings with plurals). Short summary {#summury} When translating AdGuard projects pay your close attention to phrases which require the use of plural forms. While first three types of such strings are more or less easy to perform, the fourth type demands more vigilance. And again: if you come across an original phrase with two important elements: the vertical bar sign and %count% placeholders, please do the following: Refer to the plural rule of a language you translate into; The number of your templates should be consistent with the number of plural forms your language includes, even in cases some words have fewer forms themselves. Two plural forms – two templates in translations; five plural forms – five templates, etc. Do not forget to use a vertical bar sign between templates as it is represented in original strings; Do not translate, fill in or delete %count% placeholders. By following these simple rules you will help AdGuard developers avoid a lot of unnecessary complications during the localization process. "
72,"There is an AdGuard app for virtually every major platform out there, and we regularly release updates for all of them. This would not be possible without beta testing and, more importantly, beta testers. Want to become one? Here's how you can do it. How to become a beta tester {#intro} Our requirements are easy: use AdGuard, upgrade to the beta version when it becomes available, and report any bugs you notice. However, you will need either a forum or a GitHub account (or both) to become our beta tester, so you may want to get that out of the way first. In any case, every single thing you need to know is gathered on a dedicated page. If you want to skip the description part and get straight to the action, you can apply here. Your application will be reviewed within 1-3 working days, and you'll get a reply via email. How to report a bug {#report-a-bug} If you spotted a bug or just want to share your suggestion, let us know in any of the possible ways: Go to forum.adguard.com and post there a new thread (or find an existing one) in the beta forum category. Make sure to read forum rules; Go to GitHub and find a suitable repository. Create a new issue there and describe the bug/feature request in detail. The above two methods are the most preferred, but you can use others if necessary: Find us on various social media platforms, like Facebook, Reddit, etc. However, this is not the most convenient way to discuss technical matters. Email our support team from the Support tab in the app or write directly to support@adguard.com. How to activate the beta key in the iOS application {#ios} If you have already received a beta key and it is listed in your adguard.com account, go to the app and open the license section (Get Premium). Once there, enter the credentials from your AdGuard account. After that, the premium features will become available automatically. What else? There is not much more to add. You don't have to go out of your way to find bugs. You can continue using AdGuard as usual. However, if you encounter a bug, please report it. Of course, we appreciate any additional effort and/or extra forum activity, etc. Occasionally, you will receive our newsletters, keeping you informed of the latest changes in the beta (in case you missed them) and other important news. You can unsubscribe from it at any time. "
73,"During the Installation of AdGuard on macOS High Sierra (or later versions) you may see a message: ""System Extension Blocked"". This is a new security mechanism that appeared in High Sierra, it requires you to explicitly allow the installation of a third-party system extension. To complete the installation of AdGuard you have to manually allow loading the extension in System Preferences → Security & Privacy → General. Click the ""Allow"" button, and after that you will be able to proceed with the installation as normal. "
74,"Users of AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android may notice that AdGuard adds a small script to every web page, that is loaded from the local.adguard.org domain. First of all, don't worry, this is not a real domain, and there is actually no real server with that name. This domain is used to apply cosmetic filtering to web pages, but everything is done locally right on your device without connecting to any server. Technical explanation But what's going on and why is it done? Please read the technical explanation below. AdGuard is a network-level content blocker so it cannot simply add custom JavaScript and CSS to webpages like what browser extensions do. However, doing this is crucial for quality content blocking. In order to do it AdGuard injects a ""content script"" that looks like this: <script src=""https://local.adguard.org/.../content-script.js"">. This ""content script"" takes care of cosmetic filtering, hides or removes ad content from the web pages. Connections to the IP address of the local.adguard.org domain are intercepted by AdGuard on the network level and processed locally. This is why that domain has a ""static"" IP address that does not change for years. Why do we need to use a real IP address for that? We cannot use 127.0.0.1 as the browsers won't accept it. Using some IP address from the private subnets is possible, but this solution has two downsides. First, there is a slight chance of intersecting with an existing intranet service and breaking access to it. Second, some DNS servers may consider this a DNS rebinding attack and refuse to respond to local.adguard.org. Verification This is easy to verify. If you disable AdGuard, you'll see that it is simply impossible to establish connection to local.adguard.org since there is no server with that address. Just try opening it in your browser when AdGuard is disabled. "

76,"On Android 9 and later, if AdGuard is installed for more than one user profile on your device, you may encounter problems when uninstalling the app. When you uninstall AdGuard from one user profile, the app will still appear on the app list, but you won't be able to uninstall or reinstall it. It happens because AdGuard is installed for a different user profile on the device. If you try to reinstall AdGuard after an unsuccessful removal attempt, you will see the error message ""You can't install the app on your device"". To solve this problem, you need to uninstall the application for all users: go to Settings → All apps → AdGuard. Tap the three dots at the upper right corner and select Uninstall for all users. "
77,"Userscripts (we also call them ""extensions"") are, de-facto, mini-programs written in JavaScript. They modify or extend the functionality of one or more websites. Many AdGuard users may be already familiar with such userscripts as AdGuard Assistant, Popup Blocker, and AdGuard Extra. Supported apps AdGuard can significantly broaden website functionality by acting as a userscript manager. You can add your custom scripts or manage the existing ones in our three products: AdGuard for Windows, AdGuard for Android and AdGuard for Mac. Recommended AdGuard scripts These userscripts come directly from the AdGuard developers, and we can guarantee that they are effective and safe. Remember: whenever you download a userscript from an unknown source, you expose yourself to risk, as some scripts may be harmful to your computer. Get new scripts only from the sources you trust 100%. Furthermore, here are some examples of popular sites with scripts. AdGuard Extra. An extension that blocks advertising in difficult cases when the usual filter-based approach is not enough. AdGuard Popup Blocker. The name speaks for itself: it blocks pop-ups — one of the most annoying types of ads on web pages. AdGuard Assistant (legacy version). This custom extension is designed to control filtering directly from the browser page (manual blocking, exclusion of the site, etc.). Note that this version of Assistant is legacy and there is no point in using it on new systems, since it has been replaced with the full-fledged Browser Assistant. But legacy Assistant might be of help if there is no Browser Assistant extension for your browser. Disable AMP. A script, pre-installed only in AdGuard for Android, that disables AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) on the Google search results page. Where can you get more userscripts?{#more-userscripts} As userscripts are created mainly by enthusiasts, you should be cautious when installing them. Yet, there is a great variety of interesting scripts that can really make using some websites more convenient. Here we will describe some of the most popular userscript catalogs. Stylish (userstyles.org) Userstyles.org is a catalog of user styles, but it allows you to load them as userscripts. Thus, any user style can be installed via AdGuard. Be careful if you decide to install an unpopular script — there's a risk it might be harmful. Greasy Fork Greasy Fork is a userscript catalog by Stylish creators. Unlike the above-mentioned userstyles.org, the scripts in this catalog undergo moderation, so their credibility is much higher. OpenUserJS.org OpenUserJS.org is an open source userscript catalog written in nodeJS. It doesn't have moderation so stay alert to any suspicious scripts. Community If you like the idea of personifying your browser with the help of userscripts, and you have any questions, you can ask them on one of these websites: Stackoverflow FreeNode Reddit Development Request License If you are developing your own custom script and want to test how it works with AdGuard, request a beta-license key for the app. To get it, please send an email to devteam@adguard.com with the following information: Subject: Userscript author license request Body: Please tell us about the userscripts you are working on.

79,"AdGuard for Mac needs to install the root certificate into certificate storage to be able to filter HTTPS traffic. This action is performed automatically in most cases as you run the app for the first time, but users of Gecko-based browsers (Firefox, Waterfox etc.) who have a master password set up for their browser may be required to take additional steps (because these browsers use their own certificate storage instead of the system one). They need to either enter the master password when prompted (to grant AdGuard access to the certificate storage) or manually install the certificate. To manually install the certificate into Firefox-like browser: Open ""Preferences"" Go to ""Privacy & Security"" — ""Certificates"" Click on ""View Certificates"" Navigate to the ""Authorities"" tab and click the ""Import..."" button Select file /Library/Application Support/AdGuard Software/com.adguard.mac.adguard/AdguardCore/Adguard Personal CA.cer or just download it from http://local.adguard.org/cert using a Chromium-based browser (e.g Google Chrome or new Edge) and with a HTTPS-filtering running in AdGuard Exact actions required for different Gecko-based browsers may vary, but the general sequence and the path to AdGuard Personal CA.cer file will be the same. PS: For Setapp application version the file path is the following: /Library/Application Support/com.adguard.mac.adguard-setapp/AdguardCore/Adguard Personal CA.cer "
80," Please note: AdGuard is not an antivirus program. It can warn you when you're going to visit a malware or phishing website, but it does not remove viruses from your device. If you suspect your computer is infected by malware or viruses, first of all you can inspect your computer with utilities from leading antiviruses. Free antivirus utilities {#free-antivirus} There are many of them and you can use any one you prefer, for example: Dr.Web CureIt! If this check with antivirus utilities revealed nothing, but the computer still behaves suspiciously, try to test it for adware, which can implement its advertising on any pages that you open. How to clean your system from Adware {#adware} On the Internet, you can find a lot of applications that are aimed at fighting this problem. You can use any utility you like. But we strongly recommend using AdwareCleaner by Malwarebytes, Avast One by Avast, or Adaware. These adware scanners are quite easy to use and you will be able to handle them by yourself. Let's take AdwareCleaner as an example. After the application has been downloaded and successfully installed, take the following steps: Start the application and click Scan now. Once the scan has been completed, you will need to send suspicious objects to Quarantine. When the items are moved to Quarantine, you will be able to Clear the system of unnecessary ballast. In some cases, you may need to Reboot the system after cleaning is complete. Once the system has been rebooted, cleaning will be completed. If necessary, you can always read the Report on the work done. If it didn’t help, temporary disable all extensions and some other settings in the browser according to these instructions. If disabling of settings and extensions does not help, try to recreate shortcuts of your browsers. Further on this page we describe the instructions on how to remove some of the most commonly encountered ad extensions. How to disable settings and extensions in the browser {#instructions} Below are the instructions on how to disable settings and extensions for the most popular browsers: for Google Chrome for Mozilla Firefox for Opera How to recreate shortcuts for your browsers {#shortcuts} Very often, malware and adware programs install their homepage in a very simple way — they substitute your browser's desktop shortcut, taskbar and Start menu items. The simplest solution in this case is to manually delete all the shortcuts and recreate them by yourself. "
81,"Disclosure. While AdGuard provides an option to show some ads, we do not have any 'acceptable ads' program like Adblock Plus and some other ad blockers, where they take money for leaving certain ads unblocked. This is not our case. We do not get paid for showing any of the ads, and we do not use the term 'acceptable' for a reason: the ads we might show may be, in fact, useful and not just 'acceptable'. All of this applies only to search ads and self-promotion ads. To be absolutely clear, this is completely optional. You can turn off the display of these ads at any time with no penalty whatsoever. Furthermore, we will explain which ads qualify for this definition. Search ads Search ads are ads that you see among search query results when using online search engines, such as Google, Bing, DuckDuckGo, etc. These ads are always contextual: they are targeted to match the keywords you used in the query. This helps you find exactly what you are searching for. Moreover, search ads (because they go through manual moderation) are often more relevant and helpful than the rest of the search results. Another argument in defense of search ads is that they are much less intrusive than many other ad formats. What is websites' self-promotion? In principle, when an ad on a website promotes this particular website or closely related websites, social media, and so on, such an ad is considered a self-promoting one. Our general stance here is very similar to the EasyList policy regarding self-promotion ads. According to our filter policy, we should not block these ads; however, we should not make an exception if such an ad gets blocked by some rule 'alongside' a regular ad. Partly, this is due to ethical reasons, but mostly because such ads are rarely too intrusive and are often useful for the visitor of the website (who is supposedly interested in this website's content). By enabling 'Search ads and self-promotion', AdGuard users can unblock some of these self-promotion ads. What ads are on the list? When you enable 'Search ads and self-promotion', search ads from the following search engines are shown: Google Yahoo Bing Ask Yandex DuckDuckGo StartPage As well as all self-promotional ads that satisfy our filter policy. Summary Allowing 'Search ads and self-promotion' is a 100% optional feature that may be helpful in some cases. If you don't like it, you can turn it off at any time. It does not, and never will, include any ad types or individual ads that do not fall into one of the two categories described above. "
82,"What is HTTPS? HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of the HTTP protocol that supports encryption to increase security. This protocol is used to securely transmit valuable information like personal data, credit card details, etc. Using HTTPS is highly advantageous because encrypted traffic is protected against eavesdropping by a third party, and we can only welcome this. HTTPS acceptance has been growing in recent years, mainly because it is encouraged by Google and also due to the emergence of a free certificate authority Let’s Encrypt. The diagram below describes the difference between plain HTTP protocol and secure HTTPS protocol. What is a security certificate? Simply put, HTTPS means data encryption. But there’s still a problem: how can you be sure that you’ve established an encrypted connection with the right website? That’s where security certificates come into play. A certificate serves as proof that the website is really what it tells you it is. If a website doesn’t have such a certificate, or if the certificate contains incorrect information, the browser will not allow you to establish a secure connection. It is important that the certificate a website uses is issued by a certificate authority (CA) trusted by your browser. Such a CA guarantees that the SSL certificate is, indeed, issued to the website’s owner. Why does AdGuard need to be able to filter HTTPS? Most websites are now using HTTPS, and the same applies to advertising. Here are a few popular websites where you can’t remove ads without HTTPS filtering: youtube.com, facebook.com, and twitter.com. How does HTTPS filtering work? If it were easy, HTTPS wouldn’t be that secure. When a browser attempts to connect to a server, AdGuard establishes two secure connections: one with the browser (or another app) and the other with the server. The browser must trust AdGuard and the connections it creates. For this purpose, AdGuard generates a special (and unique) root certificate and installs it into the system and, when it is required, into some browsers (e.g., Firefox). Thus, AdGuard can see what is happening inside the secure connection and do its job — block ads and trackers. For better understanding we depicted this process: Does my traffic remain encrypted and secure? Of course! Your connection with a remote server remains encrypted and secure. AdGuard, just like your browser, checks the server’s certificate before deciding whether to filter it or not. However, HTTPS filtering has its drawbacks. The most important one is that it hides from the browser the actual certificate of the website. Instead, the browser sees the certificate issued by AdGuard. Because of this, we have taken additional measures to improve connection security. Financial websites and websites with sensitive personal data By default, AdGuard doesn’t filter any information on websites of banks, payment systems, or websites with valuable personal data. We maintain a list of thousands of exclusions. If you believe some website should be added to this list, please let us know. Extended Validation (EV) certificates AdGuard allows you to disable filtering for all websites that use extended validation certificates. An EV certificate offers a higher level of security and provides more guarantees than a regular certificate, proving that the website is not fraudulent or fake. Problems related to HTTPS filtering A 2017 study shows that 5 to 10% of HTTPS connections are established by HTTPS-filtering applications. It is usually done by various kinds of antivirus software. The bad news is that 24 out of 26 tested antiviruses reduced, in various ways, the connection security level, while two-thirds created connections prone to hacking. The researchers came to a simple conclusion: the Internet security community should pay close attention to applications that filter secure connections. And the developers of such software must pay serious attention to the quality of filtering implementations. We would like to note that AdGuard was not tested in the above study. We ran estimates according to their set of tests, and at the time of testing, we could have received the maximum score – A*. However, this score is not perfect. During the study, the researchers identified some issues that were omitted in the final evaluation. Here at AdGuard, we fully agree with those conclusions. Moreover, we would like to be as open with users as possible and talk about the problems we are currently experiencing and the steps we are taking to improve the quality and security of the filtering mechanism. The list of these problems is sorted by priority. Most of the problems discovered in the above study are related to certificate validation mechanisms. This is what we want to focus on first. We are working on a separate certificate validation library. Moreover, we want to make it open source. A separate article lists all the known drawbacks of HTTPS filtering in AdGuard and our plans to fix them. HTTPS filtering issues on Android 7+ Starting from Android 7, developers have to explicitly indicate that their apps trust user-installed certificates. Not everyone wants to, or bothers with it. What does it mean for AdGuard? AdGuard installs a user certificate to be able to filter HTTPS traffic. If an app doesn't trust this certificate, its HTTPS traffic will not be filtered. What to do? The first thing worth mentioning is that many apps (even modern ones) still trust user certificates. Nothing has changed in this regard. Almost all browsers also trust such certificates. There may be some exotic browsers that do not, but they are a rare exception to common practice. Finally, if your device is rooted, you can move the AdGuard certificate to the system storage. This way, you don't have to worry about any permissions a particular app may or may not have — HTTPS traffic will be filtered for modern apps just as well as for older ones. Please keep in mind that in this case, some additional security restrictions (e.g., HPKP or Expect-CT) apply to AdGuard. How to manually check HTTPS quality? There are several dedicated websites where you can check the quality of your HTTPS connection. These websites check if your browser (or, in our case, your browser plus AdGuard) is susceptible to common vulnerabilities. If you plan to use any program that filters HTTPS, not necessarily AdGuard (e.g., an antivirus), we advise that you check the connection quality on these websites. https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/viewMyClient.html https://www.howsmyssl.com/ https://badssl.com/ "
83,"AdGuard for Windows allows users to specify a DNS server address to resolve queries instead of system DNS server, which is provided by your ISP if not overridden in the system settings. Using a non-default DNS server can safeguard your DNS traffic from the ISP’s interception. Moreover, by choosing an encrypted and/or filtering DNS server, you get another layer of protection against bad actors and annoying ads. Many AdGuard for Windows users appreciate the DNS protection feature. But some of them encounter the following issue: a check on a website like https://ipleak.net/ shows that requests are handled by default DNS server instead of the selected one. In this article we will tell you why this happens and how to avoid it. Bootstrap DNS address The DNS server addresses could be written as IPs or as domain names. In the case of IP addresses there are no difficulties: AdGuard forwards the DNS request directly to the server specified in the DNS protection module. However, encrypted DNS server addresses, like DoT or DoH, are most often written as domain names. In this case, to first resolve the encrypted DNS server address, AdGuard sends a DNS query to the bootstrap address, which is by default a system DNS server. This connection is what check services perceive as a leak. To eliminate this leak: go to the Advanced settings scroll down to the List of custom bootstrap addresses section enter the custom bootstrap address in IP address format (you may use the list of known DNS providers) click Save Fallback DNS server It could happen that AdGuard cannot reach the specified server because of a weak internet connection, an expiration of timeout set by default or some server related issues. In this case, it will connect to the fallback server, which is by default a system DNS server. This connection will also be considered by the check service as a leak. To eliminate this leak: go to the Advanced settings scroll down to the Fallback servers section check the Use custom servers option then find the List of custom fallback servers section and enter custom fallback servers one per line or go to the Advanced settings scroll down to the Fallback servers section check the Don’t use fallback servers option or go to the Advanced settings scroll down to the DNS server timeout period section enter an arbitrary large number "
84," NOTE: The ""Send statistics for ad filters usage"" option is disabled by default. Nothing will be sent unless user manually enables it to help us improve our blocking filters. Why do we need ad filters? Let's start by defining what ad filters are. Thanks to these filters, AdGuard removes ads from websites. They are manually compiled based on your complaints about ads on websites. Ad filters are an essential element of AdGuard — their quality determines the overall quality of AdGuard ad blocking. However, there is a downside. Over the years, more and more ad filters have been appearing. And the more ad filters are there, the more memory AdGuard consumes, thus slowing down the rendering of web pages. At the same time, some of the filters start to expire, gradually becoming a dead weight that has no use, only consumes memory, and slows down the program. Why do we need statistics? We want to solve the problem of outdated filtering rules once and for all. But we need your help to do so. By gathering statistics on used filtering rules, we detect and remove the rules that are no longer used. As a result, it will help all those who use AdGuard. If your computer is powerful enough, it won’t really affect you. But the difference will be very noticeable for users of low-power netbooks or tablets. What kind of statistics will be sent? If you enable the Send statistics for ad filters usage option, the following information is sent periodically: Extension version Browser type (Chrome/Firefox/Opera/Yandex.Browser/Safari). List of enabled ad filters. The list that consists of the following elements: The domain name of the website The number of recent page views The list of filtering rules and Filter ID which were activated on this website The domain name of blocked requests is sent for URL rules The list is created based on the website's visit statistics since the last time statistical data was sent. The collected statistics will be sent periodically to our server for analysis and filter optimization. It's important to note that all the statistics we get are averaged and anonymized. We don't use these statistics for any purpose other than optimizing the filters, and we do not sell this data to third parties. You can read about our Privacy Policy here. What does tracking filter rules statistics fraught with? For the vast majority of users, the change in computer speed will not be really noticeable. However, netbook and tablet users may notice a slight slowdown. Periodically, we will send the gathered statistics to the server. The size of the transmitted data is not very large and is comparable to the size of an average web page. "
85,"AdGuard for Android provides a feature called HTTPS filtering that makes it possible to filter encrypted HTTPS traffic on your Android device. This feature requires adding the AdGuard's CA certificate to the list of trusted certificates. On non-rooted devices CA certificates can be installed to the User store. Only a limited subset of apps (mostly browsers) trust CA certificates installed to the User store, meaning HTTPS filtering will work only for such apps. However, on rooted devices, you can install the certificate to the System store and allow HTTPS filtering of other apps' traffic too. Here's how to do that. How to install AdGuard's Certificate to System store (on a rooted device) Enable HTTPS filtering in AdGuard for Android and save AdGuard's certificate to the User store (use this instruction if needed) Go to AdGuard app → Menu (≡) → Settings → Network → HTTPS filtering → Security certificate → tap “Copy to the system store” That is enough for older versions of Magisk. However, if you have a newer version, you will get this message: Unable to copy the certificate to the system store. Try using “AdGuard Certificate” module. In that case, proceed to steps below: Go to Magisk → Settings Enable Zygisk Download the .zip file (of “AdGuard Certificate” module) from the latest release on GitHub Go to Magisk → Modules → Install from storage and select the downloaded .zip file Reboot If a new version of ""AdGuard certificate"" module comes out, repeat steps 3-7 to update the module. The module does its work during the system boot. If your AdGuard certificate changes, you'll have to reboot the device for the new certificate to be copied to the system store. Bromite browser Please note that in order for Bromite browser to work properly, in addition to the steps mentioned above, you need to set ""Allow user certificates"" in chrome://flags to ""Enabled"" state. Chrome and Chromium-based browsers Long story short, you will have no problems with HTTPS filtering in Chrome and Chromium-based browsers on rooted devices, if you use ""AdGuard Certificate"" module. Here is a bit more detailed explanation: Chrome (and subsequently many other Chromium-based browsers) has recently started requiring CT logs for CA certs found in the System store. ""AdGuard Certificate"" module copies AdGuard's CA certificate from the User store to the System store. It also contains a Zygisk module that reverts any modifications done by Magisk for certain browsers. This way the browsers only find AdGuard’s certificate in the User store and don’t complain about the missing CT log, while other apps continue to use the same certificate from the System store. "

Tap the Add proxy server button and enter the following data: Field Value Proxy type SOCKS5 Proxy host proxy.torguard.org or proxy.torguard.io Proxy port 1080 or 1085 or 1090 For Username and Password fields, enter your proxy username and proxy password you have chosen at TorGuard signup. Set this proxy as a default one by toggling the switch, then click Save. Enable AdGuard protection. How to use AdGuard with NordVPN Open AdGuard and go to Settings → Network → Proxy settings. Tap the Add proxy server button and enter the following data: Field Value Proxy type SOCKS5 Proxy host any server save for ""Obfuscated"" from this list Proxy port 1080 For Username and Password fields, enter your NordVPN Username and Password. Set this proxy as a default one by toggling the switch, then click Save. Enable AdGuard protection. How to use AdGuard with Shadowsocks Here we presume that you have already configured a Shadowsocks server and a client on your device. Note: You should remove Shadowsocks application from filtering before setting up the process (AdGuard - Apps management - Shadowsocks - Disable AdGuard protection) to avoid infinite loops and drops. Open AdGuard and go to Settings → Network → Proxy settings. Tap the Add proxy server and fill the fields: Field Value Proxy type SOCKS5 Proxy host 127.0.0.1 Proxy port 1080 Tap Save and select Limitations There is a factor that can prevent certain traffic from being routed through the outgoing proxy. AdGuard will only re-route traffic that goes through it. Basically, it means apps that have Ad blocking flag enabled in the Apps Management tab. "
88,"AdGuard for Safari was designed to conform to Apple's restrictions for ad blocking browser extensions and is the most popupar ad blocker for Safari. Although it can’t be compared to our desktop ad blocking apps, it's free and can protect you from ads, trackers, phishing, and malicious websites. General {#general} The first tab is the General screen where you can set up basic things like notifications, update intervals, and launching AdGuard at system startup. You can also choose to display the AdGuard icon in the menu bar. There you can also turn on content blockers to block ads, trackers, annoyances, etc. Filters {#filters} A filter is a list of rules written in a special syntax. Following these rules, content blockers can filter web traffic: block ads or requests to malicious websites. Filters are combined into eight thematic categories: Ad Blocking, Privacy, Social widgets, Annoyances, Security, Language-specific filters, Custom, and Other filters. Read more about AdGuard filters or ad filtering in general. In the Filters tab, you can enable the whole category or separate filters. Changes in the Filters tab are reflected in the Content Blockers section (located in the General tab). Content blockers {#contentblockers} A content blocker is a thematic cluster of filters. Privacy-related filters are included in the content blocker with the corresponding name — AdGuard Privacy. Content Blockers were designed for two reasons: to structure filters and to conform to Apple’s restrictions. In 2019, Apple put limitations on ad blockers for Safari, allowing them to use only 50,000 filtering rules simultaneously. As this number was not enough for an ad blocker to provide a good filtering quality (AdGuard Base Filter alone has 30,000 filtering rules), we divided AdGuard for Safari into six content blockers each containing up to 50,000 rules. In 2022, Apple increased the filtering rule limit for each content blocker to 150,000 rules applied simultaneously. Regarding AdGuard for Safari, up to 900,000 rules can be enabled for all six content blockers. Whereas the limit has been increased, the structure of content blockers has remained the same. In the Content blockers tab, you can see which content blockers are enabled, how many rules each of them is using, and which filters are functioning. You can manage enabled filters in the Filters tab. In the Content blockers section, you can only see the list of already enabled filters. AdGuard General {#adguard_general} AdGuard General is a content blocker that combines the most essential filters for blocking ads. We recommend keeping the AdGuard Base Filter always enabled. AdGuard Privacy {#adguard_privacy} This content blocker is the main tool against counters and other web analytics tools. The AdGuard Tracking Protection filter is enabled by default. AdGuard Social {#adguard_social} AdGuard Social contains filters against social media buttons, widgets, scripts, and icons. Other annoyance filters can also be found in this section: filters against pop-ups, mobile app banners, cookie notices, and more. To enable them, find Social Widgets in the Filters tab. AdGuard Security {#adguard_security} This content blocker unites several security-related filters. Malware Domains Blocklist blocks domains that are notorious for spreading malware and spyware. Spam404 protects you from Internet fraudsters. NoCoin Filter List disrupts browser-based cryptominers, such as Coinhive. AdGuard Other {#adguard_other} AdGuard Other contains filters with various functions. For example, it has a filter that unblocks search ads and self-promo ads. In some cases, it helps find exactly what you are looking for, because these kinds of ads are more relevant and less intrusive than others. Disclaimer: we don’t have any ‘acceptable ads’ paid by advertisers. Instead, we provide users with an option to see search ads and websites' self-promotion. AdGuard Custom {#adguard_custom} If you need more filters, you can add them to AdGuard Custom. To add a custom filter, enter a URL or a local file path in the relevant field. You can find new filters at filterlists.com. User rules {#userrules} User rules can be used to customize ad blocking. They can be added manually, imported, or created automatically when you block an element on the page. To add your own filering rules, use a special syntax. About {#about} In the About tab, you can see info about the current version of your product and links to legal documents. There is also a link to our repository on GitHub. You can monitor the product development, create feature requests and report bugs there. Reminder: AdGuard for Safari can be downloaded for free from the App Store. A detailed setup instruction is available in the Knowledge base. "
89,"Depending on which AdGuard app or browser extension you want to install, follow one of these links to find the relevant article: AdGuard for Android AdGuard for iOS AdGuard for Windows AdGuard for Mac AdGuard Browser extension AdGuard for Safari AdGuard Content Blocker "
90,"If you look for AdGuard in the App Store, you'll find two apps — AdGuard and AdGuard Pro. These apps are designed to block ads and trackers in Safari, other browsers, and apps, and to manage DNS protection. Don't be misled by their names, both apps block ads on smartphones and tablets by Apple. They used to differ in functionality due to the changing App Store review guidelines, but now these two apps are basically the same. So if you have purchased AdGuard Pro, there is no need to download AdGuard and buy a license there, and vice versa. Features {#features} AdGuard and AdGuard Pro for iOS offer lots of features for blocking ads, trackers and creating user rules, both in Safari and on network level. Content blockers {#content-blockers} Content blockers serve as 'containers' for filtering rules that do the actual job of blocking ads and tracking. AdGuard for iOS contains six content blockers: General, Privacy, Social, Security, Custom, and Other. Previously Apple only allowed each content blocker to contain a maximum of 50K filtering rules, but with iOS 15 release the upper limit has moved to 150K rules. All content blockers, their statuses, which thematic filters they currently include, and a total number of used filtering rules can be found on the respective screen in Advanced settings (tap the gear icon at the bottom right → General → Advanced settings → Content blockers). Tip: keep all content blockers enabled for the best filtering quality. Filters {#filters} Content blockers' work is based on filters, also sometimes referred to as filter lists. Each filter is a list of filtering rules. If you have an enabled ad blocker when browsing, it constantly checks the visited pages and elements on them against these filtering rules, and blocks anything that matches. Rules are developed to block ads, trackers, and more. All filters are grouped into thematic categories. To see the full list of these categories (not to be confused with content blockers), open the Protection section by tapping the shield icon, then go to Safari protection → Filters. There are eight of them, each category unites several filters that serve and share a common purpose, i.e. blocking ads, social media widgets, cookie notices, protecting the user from online scams. To decide which filters suit your needs, read their descriptions and navigate by the labels (ads, privacy, recommended, etc.). More enabled filters does not guarantee that there will be less ads. A large number of various filters enabled simultaneously reduces the quality of ad blocking. Custom filters category is empty by default for users to add there their filters by URL. You can find filters on the Internet or even try to create one by yourself. User rules {#user-rules} Here you can add new rules — either by entering them manually, or by using the AdGuard manual blocking tool in Safari. Use this tool to customize Safari filtering without adding an entire filter list. Learn how to create your own ad filters. But please note that many of them won't work in Safari on iOS. Allowlist {#allowlist} The third section of the Safari protection screen. If you want to disable ad blocking on a certain website, Allowlist will be of help. It allows you to add domains and subdomains to exlcusions. AdGuard for iOS has an Import/Export feature, so the allowlist from one device can be easily transferred to another. DNS protection {#dns-protection} DNS protection module enhances your privacy by encrypting your DNS traffic. Unlike with Safari content blocking, DNS protection works system-wide, i.e. beyond Safari, in apps and other browsers. You have to enable this module before you're able to use it. You can do this on the home screen by tapping the shield icon at the top of the screen, or by going to the Protection → DNS protection tab. To be able to manage DNS settings, AdGuard apps require establishing a local VPN. It will not route your traffic through any remote servers. Nevertheless, the system will ask you to confirm access permission. DNS implementation {#dns-implementation} This section has two options: AdGuard and Native implementation. Basically, these are two methods of setting up DNS. In Native implementation, the DNS is handled by the system and not the app. This means that AdGuard doesn't have to create a local VPN. Sadly, this will not help you circumvent system restrictions and use AdGuard alongside other VPN-based applications — if any VPN is enabled, native DNS is ignored. Consequently, you won't be able to filter traffic locally or to use our brand new DNS-over-QUIC protocol (DoQ). DNS servers {#dns-servers} The first section you'll see on the DNS Protection screen is DNS server. It shows the currently selected DNS server and encryption type. To change either, tap the button to enter the DNS server screen. Servers differ by their speed, employed protocol, trustworthiness, logging policy, etc. By default, AdGuard will suggest several DNS servers from among the most popular ones (including AdGuard DNS). Tap any to change the encryption type (if such option is provided by the server's owner) or to view the server's homepage. We added labels such as No logging policy, Ad blocking, Security to help you make a choice. In addition, at the bottom of the screen there is an option to add a custom DNS server. It supports regular, DNSCrypt, DNS-over-HTTPS, DNS-over-TLS, and DNS-over-QUIC servers. Network settings {#network-settings} Users can also handle their DNS security on the Network settings screen. Filter mobile data and Filter Wi-Fi enable or disable DNS protection for the respective network types. Further down, at Wi-Fi exceptions, you can exclude particular Wi-Fi networks from DNS protection (for example, you might want to exclude your home network if you use AdGuard Home). DNS filtering {#dns-filtering} To get access to this setting, Advanced mode has to be enabled from the General settings screen. After that, a new section will appear on the DNS protection screen. Tap it to customize your DNS traffic by applying own rules. DNS filters {#dns-filters} Similar to filters that work in Safari, DNS filters are sets of rules written according to special syntax. AdGuard will monitor your DNS traffic and block requests that match one or more rules. You can use filters such as AdGuard DNS filter or add hosts files as filters. Multiple filters can be added simultaneously. To know how to do it, get acquainted with this exhaustive manual. Allowlist and Blocklist {#allowlist-blocklist} On top of DNS filters, you can have targeted impact on DNS filtering by adding single domains to Blocklist or to Allowlist. Blocklist even supports the same DNS syntax, and both of them can be imported and exported, just like Allowlist in Safari content blocking. Advanced protection {#advanced-protection} In iOS 15 Apple has added the support for Safari Web Extensions, and we in turn added a new Advanced protection module to AdGuard for iOS. It allows AdGuard to apply advanced filtering rules, such as CSS rules, CSS selectors, and scriptlets, and therefore to deal even with the complex ads, such as YouTube ads. To enable Advanced protection, open the Protection tab by tapping the second left icon at the bottom of the screen, select the Advanced protection module, activate the feature by toggling the switch slider, and follow the instructions below. The Advanced protection only works on iOS 15 and later versions. If you are using earlier versions of iOS, you will see the YouTube ad blocking module in the app instead of the Advanced protection. Compatibility with AdGuard VPN {#compatibility} In most cases, the ad blocker and the VPN application cannot work together, simply because there are certain system limitations. Nevertheless we've managed to find a solution to befriend AdGuard VPN and AdGuard Ad Blocker. For your convenience we've added the AdGuard VPN block to the Protection section, so you can easily switch between two apps. Assistant {#assistant} Assistant is a tool that helps you manage filtering in Safari right from the browser without switching back to the app. To see it, do the following: open Safari and tap the arrow-in-a-box symbol. Then scroll down to AdGuard/AdGuard Pro (depending on the app you use) and tap it to fetch a window with several options: Enable on this page. Turn the switch off to add the current domain to the Allowlist. Block an element on this page. Tap it to enter the 'Element blocking' mode: choose any element on the page, adjust the size by tapping 'plus' or 'minus', preview if necessary and then tap the checkmark icon to confirm. The selected element will be hidden from the page and a corresponding rule will be added to User rules. Remove or disable it there to revert the change. Report an issue on this page. Opens a web reporting tool that will help you send a report to our support team in just a few taps. Use it if you noticed a missed ad or an incorrect blocking on the page. On iOS 15 devices, the Assistant features are available through AdGuard Safari Web Extension, which enhances the capabilities of AdGuard for iOS and allows you to take advantage of iOS 15. With this web extension, AdGuard can apply advanced filter rules and, as a result, block more ads. Activity {#activity} This is the 'information hub' of AdGuard's DNS protection suite. You can quickswitch to it by tapping the third icon in the row at the screen bottom. N.b. this screen is only seen when DNS protection is enabled. Here AdGuard displays stats about device's DNS requests, such as total number, number of encrypted requests and average processing time. AdGuard can display the stats for a day, a week, a month, or in total. Below is the Recent activity feed. AdGuard stores the last 1500 DNS requests that have originated on your device and shows their attributes such as protocol type and target domain. AdGuard does not send this information anywhere. It is 100% local and does not leave your device. Tap any request to view more details. There will also be buttons to add the request to Blocklist/Allowlist in one tap. Above the activity feed, there are Most active companies. Aggregated data on the last 1500 requests are shown here. Statistics {#statistics} Aside from the Activity screen, you can find global statistics on the home screen and on widgets. Low-level settings {#low-level-settings} To open the Low-level settings, go to Settings → General → (Enable Advanced mode if it's off) → Advanced settings → Low-level settings. For the most part, the settings in this section are best left untouched: only use them if you're sure about what you're doing, or if the support team has asked for them. But some settings could be changed without any risk. Block IPv6 {#blockipv6} For any DNS query sent to get an IPv6 address, our app returns an empty response (as if this IPv6 address does not exist). Now there is an option not to return IPv6 addresses. At this point the description of this function becomes too technical: configuring or disabling IPv6 is the exclusive domain of advanced users. Presumably, if you are one of them, it will be good to know that we now have this feature, if not – there is no need to dive into it. Bootstrap and Fallback servers {#bootstrap-fallback} Fallback is a backup DNS server. If you chose a DNS server and something happened to it, a fallback is needed to set the backup DNS server until the main server responds. With Bootstrap, it’s a little more complicated. For AdGuard for iOS to use a custom secure DNS server, our app needs to get its IP address first. For this purpose, the system DNS is used by default, but sometimes this is not possible for various reasons. In such cases, Bootstrap could be used to get the IP address of the selected secure DNS server. Here are two examples to illustrate when a custom Bootstrap server might help: When a system default DNS server does not return the IP address of a secure DNS server and it is not possible to use a secure one. When our app and third-party VPN are used simultaneously and it is not possible to use System DNS as a Bootstrap. Other features {#other-features} While Safari content blocking and DNS protection are indisputably two major modules of AdGuard/AdGuard Pro, there are some other minor features that don't fall into either of them directly but still can be useful and are worth knowing about. Dark theme Residing right at the top of Settings → General screen, this setting allows you to switch between dark and light themes. Widgets AdGuard supports widgets that provide quick access to Safari content blocking and DNS protection switches, and also show global requests stats. Auto-update over Wi-Fi only If this setting is enabled, AdGuard will use only Wi-Fi for background filter updates. Invert the Allowlist An alternative mode for Safari filtering, it unblocks ads everywhere except for the specified websites from the list. Disabled by default. Advanced mode Aside from unlocking DNS filtering, it grants access to Advanced settings. We don't recommend messing with those, unless you know what you're doing or you have consulted with technical support first. Reset statistics Clears all statistical data, such as number of requests, etc. Reset settings This option will reset all your settings. Support Use this option to contact support, report a missed ad (although we advise to use the Assistant or AdGuard's Safari Web extension for your own convenience), export logs or to make a feature request. About Contains the current version of the app and an assortment of rarely needed options and links. "
91,"Every day, tens of thousands of people fall prey to virus attacks or fraud on the Internet. We have added special filters to the AdGuard app to protect you from malicious and phishing websites. So far, we have categorized more than 15 million sites, and our filters contain about 1.5 million phishing and malware sites. Just think about it: 10% of all known sites can be dangerous for you! Inexperienced users can easily become victims of fraudsters or hackers. We hope that using protection against malicious websites will help you avoid all hazards that you may encounter. How does a check work? The scope and methods of checks depend on the product you use. In our browser extensions, AdGuard inspects only the pages you visit. In AdGuard for Windows, Mac, or Android, we offer you the best possible protection by checking both the pages and all objects loaded on them. AdGuard for Windows, Mac, and Android We use the protocol Safe Browsing API version 2.2 for our work with filters. This protocol allows us to keep your personal data absolutely safe. Our server knows nothing about the websites that you visit. We use hash prefixes for checks, not the opened URLs. The figure below provides a general understanding of how the Browsing Security module works, using AdGuard for Windows as an example. AdGuard Browser extensions Browser extensions work differently, using the so-called Lookup API to check the pages you visit. Every time you visit any website, your local client exchanges information with our backend server in the form of hashes and hash prefixes. For those interested in the process at a deeper level, the link above will be helpful. As a result of that exchange, the local client determines if the website belongs to the database of potentially dangerous websites or not. We bring to your attention that we never get any information that could allow us to determine which websites you visit and use that data in any way. An approximate algorithm of the functioning of the Browsing Security module is shown in the picture below. AdGuard filters We currently maintain two AdGuard filters. One protects against phishing and fraudulent websites. The other protects against malicious websites, visiting which may lead to a virus infection. Phishing sites filter Phishing is a type of online fraud aimed at gaining access to confidential data of users — username and password. If you are interested in this topic, we suggest that you read this article at Wikipedia. Apart from phishing sites, this filter also covers different fraudulent sites, including all kinds of scams, sales of nonexistent content, and such. Malicious sites filter This filter contains links to pages that lead to the execution of malicious code. It can initiate leakage or loss of data or harm the device of a user. It can be authorized (for example, when downloading and running the executable file) or unauthorized (for example, when being attacked with spyware). How do we fill up our filters? Our filters are constantly filled with new addresses. Since most of the work is automated, you can be sure that new malware and phishing addresses fall into our database as quickly as possible. AdGuard Browsing Security Community An important tool for maintaining the highest level of filtering is AdGuard Browsing Security Community. Any user of our products — be it AdGuard for Windows or our browser extension — can become a member of the community and help us in the making of AdGuard filters. In the picture below we described an algorithm of Browsing Security Community work: Want to help? We will gladly accept any help! If you want to send us a complaint about a phishing or malware site, you can do it via technical support at support@adguard.com or on our forum. False-positive responses Occasionally, some non-malicious websites get added to AdGuard's filters. We do our best to reduce the percentage of false positives, but they still occur. If you come across this behavior from AdGuard, please send us a complaint about the false-positive alarm. You can submit such complaints via our technical support at support@adguard.com or on our forum. "

93,"Filtering rules {#filtering-rules} As you probably know, AdGuard uses filtering rules to block ads, and these rules are combined into thematic blocking filters, like AdGuard Base filter, Mobile ads filter, etc. Read more about how ad blocking works. Websites constantly change the way they embed ads, and we add new rules to our filters to keep them effective. Filter engineers are working on creating new rules, but we always welcome the help and support of volunteers. How to start {#how-to-start} However, working with blocking filters requires specific skills. If you have them and know how to create rules, then head straight to our AdGuard Filters repository on GitHub. There you will find a lot of open issues, each one referencing a problem with some website problem — a missed ad, a false positive, etc. Choose any and suggest your own rules in comments. AdGuard filter engineers will review your suggestions, and if they find them appropriate, your rules will be added to AdGuard filters. If you are not yet familiar with our filtering rules syntax, or maybe need a refresher, you'll find the basics about the syntax in our Knowledge base. More advanced guides can be found on the internet, and if you have any questions about the syntax, visit our forum. Rewards {#rewards} If you have suggested several filtering rules and some of them were approved, then it's time for you to get a reward. Send us a message at st@adguard.com with your GitHub account name, and you'll get a free AdGuard license key. As for the exact number of rules you need to get approved to become eligible, there are no hard rules. This task is not easy, so anything north of 5 should be enough. "
